"""Fine-grained class-layout descriptor diff (layout-closure work).

The coarse type detectors compare ``sizeof`` (``TYPE_SIZE_CHANGED``) and field
offsets, but a class layout has more moving parts that those under-represent:

* a **base-class subobject** can move within the derived object (e.g. an
  empty-base optimization is lost, or a member/base is inserted ahead of it)
  without the *declaration order* of bases changing;
* a previously non-polymorphic class can gain its first virtual function, so the
  compiler **prepends a vtable pointer** — sizeof grows and every member shifts;
* a type can stop being **trivially copyable** (changing how it is passed/returned
  by value — in registers vs. via a hidden reference) or **standard-layout**
  (changing ``offsetof`` / C interop / tail-padding-reuse rules);
* the **data size** (``dsize``: the bytes the object's own members occupy,
  excluding trailing tail padding) can change while ``sizeof`` stays the same — a
  derived class may reuse a base's tail padding, so this silently shifts a
  derived layout even when the base's ``sizeof`` is unchanged.

This detector reads the optional layout fields on :class:`~abicheck.model.RecordType`
(``base_offsets``, ``vptr_offset_bits``, ``data_size_bits``, ``is_standard_layout``,
``is_trivially_copyable``) and emits the corresponding ``ChangeKind``. Every
comparison is **tri-state guarded** — it fires only when *both* sides carry the
relevant evidence — so an evidence-tier downgrade (DWARF-only or symbols-only
dump, or an older snapshot whose schema predates these fields) never fabricates a
finding. On any snapshot that doesn't populate the descriptor (all fields default
to ``None``/empty), the detector is completely inert.

``LAYOUT_UNVERIFIABLE`` is the calm, non-escalating counterpart: when one side
carries a populated layout descriptor but the other has *no* layout evidence at
all (``size_bits is None``), we cannot confirm or rule out a layout change, so we
say so without raising an alarm.
