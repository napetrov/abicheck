    Uses ElfSymbol.size from .dynsym to create fingerprints for rename matching.
    Includes FUNC, IFUNC, and NOTYPE symbols — matching dumper.py's
    ``exported_dynamic_funcs`` categorization for elf_only_mode snapshots.
    Code hashing requires the binary file and is handled by
    ``binary_fingerprint.compute_function_fingerprints()`` when a path is available.
