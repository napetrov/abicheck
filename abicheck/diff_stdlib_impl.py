"""Cross-implementation standard-library compatibility diff (D-stdlib).

ABI compatibility has a third axis beyond backward/forward: compatibility
*between different standard-library implementations*. The C++ standard never
guarantees it. A class that embeds a ``std::`` container/string **by value**
gets a different layout under libstdc++ vs libc++ vs the MSVC STL (different
``sizeof``, different member offsets), so the same source linked against a
mismatched runtime is silently ABI-incompatible — exactly the
``class A { std::vector<T> v; };`` trap.

This detector compares the normalized :class:`~abicheck.build_mode.BuildMode`
captured on each snapshot and emits a RISK finding when the standard-library
implementation (or the libc++ ABI version) differs. It is deliberately
conservative:

* It works on real snapshots, **not just captured build-mode.** The normalized
  ``build_mode`` field is not populated by every dump path, so the detector
  falls back to recovering the stdlib family from the mangled symbol names
  (which are always present and serialized) — see :func:`_effective_build_mode`.
* It is **quiet when evidence is missing.** When neither a captured build-mode
  nor any mangled symbol reveals the stdlib family (it stays ``UNKNOWN``), it
  emits nothing — it does not guess and it does not escalate. The absence of
  evidence is a reason to stay silent, not to raise an alarm.
* It defaults to **RISK, never BREAKING.** When a public type embeds a stdlib
  type *by value* and its layout actually differs, that owner type is itself a
  non-``std::`` type (e.g. ``class A``) and is therefore never filtered, so the
  type diff emits its ``TYPE_SIZE_CHANGED``/offset BREAKING finding through the
  ordinary path; this kind explains and localizes the root cause. We do **not**
  globally un-filter standalone ``std::`` records in the cross-implementation
  case — across implementations they differ wholesale and would flood BREAKING
  noise for toolchain-owned internals (see
  :func:`abicheck.model.stdlib_namespaces_excluded`). Fine-grained, per-owner
  attribution of the specific embedded ``std::`` field is deferred to the
  layout-closure work.
