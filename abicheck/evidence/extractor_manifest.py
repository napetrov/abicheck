"""External CLI evidence extractors, driven by a manifest (ADR-032 D3).

A third-party build system can be integrated *without importing untrusted Python
into the abicheck process*: the operator registers a YAML manifest that declares
the extractor's name, capabilities, allowed actions, the commands to run for each
lifecycle phase, and the normalized outputs it produces. abicheck then talks to
it over a subprocess boundary with declared inputs and outputs.

Security model (D3 + D5):

* **Trusted-by-operator, never auto-discovered.** :func:`load_extractor_manifest`
  loads exactly the path it is given. Nothing here scans ``PATH``, the working
  tree, or any plugin directory — an external extractor runs only when the
  operator registers it explicitly (``--extractor-manifest <path>``).
* **Declared actions are a ceiling, not a grant.** The manifest's
  ``allowed_actions`` are intersected at run time with the actions the operator
  enabled (:func:`~abicheck.evidence.extractor.resolve_allowed_actions`); a
  manifest can never escalate beyond the run-permitted set. Before any phase
  runs, every action the manifest declares it needs must be permitted, or
  collection fails with :class:`~abicheck.evidence.extractor.ActionNotPermittedError`.
* **No shell, sanitized environment.** Commands run as an argv list with
  ``shell=False`` and a minimal environment, so a manifest cannot smuggle a
  shell pipeline or leak the operator's full environment to the tool.

The pure halves — manifest parsing and command-template rendering — are
unit-testable without any external binary; only :meth:`ExternalCliExtractor._run`
shells out.
