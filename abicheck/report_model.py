"""A render-ready view of a comparison result (C2 — ADR-036).

Output formats used to each re-apply the ``show_only`` filter and re-derive the
verdict-axis buckets (breaking / source-break / risk / compatible) on their own.
:class:`ReportModel` computes those *once* from a :class:`DiffResult` so renderers
become thin projections over a single, canonical classification.

Canonical severity (ADR-036): the **verdict axis** — each finding's
``result._effective_verdict_for_change(c)`` (policy-file overrides + ADR-027 A4
per-finding modulation respected). This is the same partition that drives the
overall verdict and the process exit code, so the report can never disagree with
the gate. The ABICC-style display severity (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW in
``report_classifications``) and the symbol-origin axis (rtti/internal/public in
``report_summary``) are *separate projections*, deliberately not collapsed into
this one — they answer different questions.

Cycle-safety: this module imports only ``checker_policy`` and ``report_summary``.
The ``show_only`` filter lives in ``reporter`` (``apply_show_only``); callers
apply it and pass the already-filtered change list in, so ``report_model`` never
imports ``reporter`` — ``reporter`` depends on this module one-directionally.

# ── Canonical cross-axis presentation mapping (ADR-036) ──────────────────────
#
# All output channels share ONE authoritative table mapping the canonical
# verdict to each channel's vocabulary. The axes are deliberately distinct (they
# answer different questions and have different origins) — the point of this
# table is that the *mapping between them* lives in exactly one place, so they
# can be related and verified rather than re-encoded per renderer.
#
#   verdict                | native label | SARIF level | breaking boundary
#   -----------------------|--------------|-------------|------------------
#   BREAKING               | breaking     | error       | yes
#   API_BREAK              | api_break    | error       | yes
#   COMPATIBLE_WITH_RISK   | risk         | warning     | no
#   COMPATIBLE             | compatible   | note        | no
#
# Two further axes are intentionally NOT verdict-derived and keep their own
# single-source mappings (see ADR-036):
#   * ABICC display severity (High/Medium/Low) — kind-based, ABICC parity,
#     in ``report_classifications.severity``.
#   * symbol origin (rtti/internal/public) — name-based, in
#     ``name_classification.symbol_origin``.
# The SARIF *level* here is the override-path mapping; SARIF additionally uses a
# finer per-kind level for non-overridden findings (``policy_for(kind).severity``).
