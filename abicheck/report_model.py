"""A render-ready view of a comparison result (C2 — ADR-035).

Output formats used to each re-apply the ``show_only`` filter and re-derive the
verdict-axis buckets (breaking / source-break / risk / compatible) on their own.
:class:`ReportModel` computes those *once* from a :class:`DiffResult` so renderers
become thin projections over a single, canonical classification.

Canonical severity (ADR-035): the **verdict axis** — each finding's
``result._effective_verdict_for_change(c)`` (policy-file overrides + ADR-027 A4
per-finding modulation respected). This is the same partition that drives the
overall verdict and the process exit code, so the report can never disagree with
the gate. The ABICC-style display severity (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW in
``report_classifications``) and the symbol-origin axis (rtti/internal/public in
``report_summary``) are *separate projections*, deliberately not collapsed into
this one — they answer different questions.

Cycle-safety: this module imports only ``checker_policy`` and ``report_summary``.
The ``show_only`` filter lives in ``reporter`` (``apply_show_only``); callers
apply it and pass the already-filtered change list in, so ``report_model`` never
imports ``reporter`` — ``reporter`` depends on this module one-directionally.
