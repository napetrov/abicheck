"""Compile-unit include graph for the L5 graph (ADR-031 D3, phase 7).

Adds ``COMPILE_UNIT_INCLUDES_FILE`` edges from compiler depfiles (``-M``/``-MM``
output) — the ADR-029 D3 / ADR-031 D3 source for "compile unit → include
edges". The depfile *parser* is a pure function exercised by unit tests; the
live ``clang -M`` invocation is integration-only and degrades gracefully, like
the L4 source extractors and the call-graph extractor.
