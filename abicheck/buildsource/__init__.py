"""Optional source/build/graph evidence layers (ADR-028).

This sub-package implements the *BuildSourcePack* architecture: an optional,
content-addressed, independently-versioned artifact that augments an
``AbiSnapshot`` with build-context (L3), source ABI replay (L4), and
source/implementation graph (L5) evidence.

Authority rule (ADR-028 D3): artifact-backed L0/L1/L2 evidence remains the
shipped-ABI source of truth. Evidence from L3/L4/L5 may *explain, localize,
add confidence, scope, or correlate* an artifact-proven break, but must never
silently delete it. Findings produced only by L3/L4/L5 are ordinary
``ChangeKind`` entries that default to ``API_BREAK_KINDS`` (source breaks) or
``RISK_KINDS`` (deployment/context risk), never ``BREAKING_KINDS`` unless an
artifact diff also proves the break.

Phase 0 (this module) ships the manifest, coverage model, on-disk pack layout,
and snapshot reference. ADR-029 adds the build-evidence model and adapters.
