    A symbol the library author bound to a ``*_INTERNAL_*`` / ``*PRIVATE*`` ELF
    version node is exported but is not public ABI (the
    ``abi-compliance-checker`` header-scoped tracker correctly ignores it; see
    ``validation/realworld-tracker-parity-2026-06.md`` class A — nettle 3.6→3.7).
    abicheck's binary-strict default would otherwise score a real change to such a
    symbol (removal, signature change, internal data-table resize, or the rename
    of the internal node itself) as ``BREAKING``.

    This reclassifies each such finding to ``COMPATIBLE_WITH_RISK`` via the
    per-finding ``effective_verdict`` modulation hook (ADR-025) — binary-compatible
    for conforming consumers, a deployment risk only for anyone who illegally
    linked an internal symbol, exactly the ``GLIBC_PRIVATE`` semantics. It is
    deliberately conservative:

    * only findings whose *kind* is already BREAKING/API_BREAK are touched (it
      never escalates a compatible finding);
    * the per-symbol set is derived from the **old** side's actual ELF version
      bindings — that is the surface old consumers linked against. A symbol that
      was *public* in the old SONAME but rebound to an internal node in the new
      binary (``foo@LIBFOO_1.0`` → ``foo@LIBFOO_PRIVATE``) is **not** demoted: old
      consumers still require ``foo@LIBFOO_1.0`` and a real change to it breaks
      them (Codex review #354). A public function whose name merely contains
      ``internal`` is likewise never matched (the test is on the version node);
    * findings already carrying a ``frozen_namespace_violation`` or a prior
      ``effective_verdict`` override are left untouched.

    ``new_elf`` is accepted for symmetry/future use but intentionally does not
    widen the internal set — see the old-side rationale above.
