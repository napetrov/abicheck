"""Release-recommendation helper: verdict + change set → semver bump + SONAME action.

A library maintainer's first practical question after running a comparison is
*"what version do I release, and do I need to bump the SONAME?"*. abicheck
already has every signal needed to answer that — the policy-aware verdict and
the per-change classification — but historically left the mapping to the user.

This module derives a :class:`ReleaseRecommendation` from a :class:`DiffResult`:

==================  ===========  =====================  ==========================
Verdict             Bump         SONAME                 Why
==================  ===========  =====================  ==========================
NO_CHANGE           none         no_bump_needed         nothing changed
BREAKING            major        bump_required/…        binary ABI break
API_BREAK           major        no_bump_needed         source break, binary OK
COMPATIBLE_WITH_RISK minor/patch no_bump_needed         deployment-floor risk
COMPATIBLE (adds)   minor        no_bump_needed         new public API surface
COMPATIBLE (quality) patch       no_bump_needed         bad-practice only
==================  ===========  =====================  ==========================

The mapping follows the conventional split between the *API* contract (governs
the package's semantic version) and the *ABI* contract (governs the ELF SONAME /
Mach-O compatibility-version). A source-only break (``API_BREAK``) is a MAJOR
semver event but leaves the binary loadable, so the SONAME need not change; a
binary break (``BREAKING``) requires both.
