"""Public-ABI surface resolution (ADR-024, Phase 2).

Derives the *public* ABI surface of a snapshot from information already
captured at dump time, then classifies individual diff findings as
in-surface (public) or out-of-surface (private / internal).

The surface is computed from two facts that the dumper already records:

1. **Linkage + header scope** — :class:`~abicheck.model.Visibility`. A
   function/variable is :data:`Visibility.PUBLIC` only when it is *both*
   exported *and* declared in one of the user-provided public headers
   (see ADR-016). ``ELF_ONLY`` / ``HIDDEN`` symbols are therefore not part
   of the public surface.
2. **Type reachability** — a record/enum/typedef is public iff it is
   reachable from a public function/variable through return types,
   parameter types, data members, base classes, or typedef targets. The
   closure deliberately follows *all* data members (including private and
   pointer-typed ones): this over-keeps rather than risks hiding a layout
   dependency, and precise by-value-vs-pointer reachability is left to a
   later phase (ADR-024 §D3).

This module performs *no* deletion on its own; it only answers "is this
finding about the public surface?".  The pipeline step that consumes it
(``FilterNonPublicSurface``) moves out-of-surface findings to an audit
ledger rather than dropping them silently — see ADR-024 §D4/D5.

Design constraints (ADR-024 §D5, anti-hiding):

* Internal-leak findings are **never** treated as out-of-surface — a
  private type reachable from a public API is exactly the signal scoping
  must not hide.
* When the surface cannot be resolved (no headers were provided, so every
  symbol is ``ELF_ONLY``), scoping is a no-op: we keep every finding.
* Type names we cannot place are kept (conservative — never hide an
  unknown).
