"""Bundle-aware multi-library ABI analysis (ADR-023).

The per-library compare implemented in ``checker.compare`` treats each
library as an isolated unit. Real releases (oneDAL, libtorch, etc.) ship
multiple libraries that reference each other's symbols; intra-bundle
breakage (sibling removes a symbol another sibling imports, extern-C
signature drift across the DSO boundary, cross-DSO type drift, provider
migration, instantiation-manifest drift) is invisible to per-library diff.

This module computes a *bundle finding* layer on top of per-library diff
results. It reuses :mod:`abicheck.resolver` for the dependency graph and
:mod:`abicheck.elf_metadata` for ELF parsing. The actual per-library diff
input is what ``compare-release`` already produces.

Public surface:
    - :class:`BundleSnapshot`     — a release viewed as a set of libraries.
    - :class:`BundleFinding`      — one cross-library change with provider
                                    and consumer attribution.
    - :class:`BundleDiffResult`   — output of :func:`compare_bundle`.
    - :func:`compare_bundle`      — main entry point.

Bundle findings use the ``ChangeKind.BUNDLE_*`` values registered in
:mod:`abicheck.change_registry`. They participate in policy classification,
suppression, severity, and reporter machinery identically to per-library
``Change`` entries.
