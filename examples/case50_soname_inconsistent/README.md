# Case 50: SONAME Inconsistent (Wrong Major Version)

**Policy verdict:** 🟡 BAD PRACTICE | **ABI compatibility verdict:** COMPATIBLE

## What this case is about

Both libraries export the same symbols with identical signatures. The difference
is in the `DT_SONAME` metadata: v1 uses `libfoo.so.0` while the project release
version is 1.x (implying the correct SONAME should be `libfoo.so.1`).

This is a **policy-level bad practice**: the SONAME is present (unlike Case 05)
but does not follow the convention of matching the ABI epoch / major version.

## Why SONAME inconsistency is bad practice

- **Package managers** (dpkg, rpm) use SONAME to generate dependency lists.
  A wrong SONAME major means packages depend on the wrong `libfoo.so.0` and
  will fail to find `libfoo.so.1` after a correct upgrade.
- **Parallel installation** is broken: `libfoo.so.0` and `libfoo.so.1` are meant
  to coexist, but if the library was always `libfoo.so.0`, upgrading to the real
  ABI epoch `1` forces unnecessary coordinated rebuilds.
- **ldconfig** creates symlinks based on SONAME. A stale SONAME means the wrong
  symlink tree, breaking runtime lookup for correctly-linked binaries.

## What abicheck detects

- **`SONAME_CHANGED`**: The SONAME differs between v1 and v2 (`.so.0` vs `.so.1`).
  This is classified as a metadata change. Because the actual symbols and types
  are identical, the functional ABI is compatible.

**Policy verdict: 🟡 BAD PRACTICE** (SONAME mismatch is a packaging/upgrade hazard).
**ABI compatibility verdict: COMPATIBLE** (same ABI surface; symbols and types identical).

## How to reproduce

```bash
# Build both variants
gcc -shared -fPIC -g bad.c -o libbad.so -Wl,-soname,libfoo.so.0
gcc -shared -fPIC -g good.c -o libgood.so -Wl,-soname,libfoo.so.1

# Verify SONAME
readelf -d libbad.so  | grep SONAME
# → (SONAME) Library soname: [libfoo.so.0]  ← wrong major
readelf -d libgood.so | grep SONAME
# → (SONAME) Library soname: [libfoo.so.1]  ← correct

# Run abicheck
python3 -m abicheck.cli dump libbad.so  -o /tmp/v1.json
python3 -m abicheck.cli dump libgood.so -o /tmp/v2.json
python3 -m abicheck.cli compare /tmp/v1.json /tmp/v2.json
# → COMPATIBLE + SONAME_CHANGED note
```

## How to fix

Set SONAME to match your project's ABI major version:

```bash
gcc -shared -fPIC lib.c -o libfoo.so.1.2.3 -Wl,-soname,libfoo.so.1
ln -sf libfoo.so.1.2.3 libfoo.so.1
ln -sf libfoo.so.1 libfoo.so
```

In CMake:
```cmake
set_target_properties(foo PROPERTIES
    VERSION 1.2.3
    SOVERSION 1
)
```

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: BAD PRACTICE**

**Scenario:** app links against library with wrong SONAME, then we inspect DT_NEEDED.

```bash
# Build with wrong SONAME
gcc -shared -fPIC -g bad.c -o libfoo.so -Wl,-soname,libfoo.so.0
ln -sf libfoo.so libfoo.so.0   # create SONAME symlink so loader finds it
gcc -g app.c -L. -lfoo -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
readelf -d app | grep NEEDED
# → (NEEDED) Shared library: [libfoo.so.0]  ← wrong major baked in
./app
# → foo() = 42, bar(5) = 6  (works today)

# After upgrade, libfoo.so.1 exists but app still looks for libfoo.so.0
# → runtime error: libfoo.so.0: cannot open shared object file
```

**Why BAD PRACTICE:** Runtime works today, but the wrong SONAME major
gets baked into every consumer's DT_NEEDED. Future upgrades to the
correct SONAME require rebuilding all consumers.

## Real-world example

Debian's shared library policy requires SONAME to follow the
`libname.so.MAJOR` convention. Packages with inconsistent SONAMEs are
rejected during review because they break upgrade paths.
