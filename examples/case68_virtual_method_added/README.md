# Case 68: Virtual Method Added to Non-Virtual Class

**Category:** Class Layout / Vtable | **Verdict:** BREAKING

## What breaks

The `Sensor` class gains a virtual destructor and `read()` becomes virtual. This
introduces a **vtable pointer** (`vptr`) as a hidden member at the beginning of
the object. On x86-64, this adds 8 bytes to the object size and shifts **every
data member** to a higher offset:

| Member | v1 offset | v2 offset | Shift |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| *(vptr)* | — | 0 | *new* |
| `value_` | 0 | 8 | +8 |
| `id_` | 8 | 16 | +8 |
| **sizeof** | **16** | **24** | **+8** |

Any consumer compiled against v1 that accesses `value_` at offset 0 will instead
read the vtable pointer — interpreting a memory address as a `double`, producing
astronomically wrong values.

## Why this matters

Adding the first virtual method to a class is one of the most destructive ABI
changes possible, because it fundamentally alters the object layout:

1. **Object size increases**: `sizeof(Sensor)` grows by `sizeof(void*)`, breaking
   stack allocation, arrays, and embedding in other structs
2. **All fields shift**: every data member moves to accommodate the vtable pointer,
   causing every field access to read/write the wrong memory
3. **Construction changes**: the constructor now initializes the vtable pointer,
   adding a hidden write that wasn't there before
4. **Copy semantics change**: memcpy of the object must include the vtable pointer
5. **It's a one-way door**: once virtual, removing virtuality is equally breaking

This is especially common when adding:
- A virtual destructor (for proper cleanup through base pointers)
- A virtual method for plugin/extension APIs
- A virtual method for testing/mocking

## Code diff

```cpp
// v1: non-virtual class (no vtable pointer)
class Sensor {
public:
    double value_;  // offset 0
    int    id_;     // offset 8
    Sensor(int id, double initial);
    double read() const;        // non-virtual
};
// sizeof(Sensor) = 16

// v2: virtual methods added (vtable pointer inserted!)
class Sensor {
public:
    double value_;  // offset 8 (shifted!)
    int    id_;     // offset 16 (shifted!)
    Sensor(int id, double initial);
    virtual ~Sensor();            // NEW virtual destructor
    virtual double read() const;  // NOW virtual
};
// sizeof(Sensor) = 24
```

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: CRITICAL**

**Scenario:** compile app against v1 (non-virtual, 16 bytes), link to v2 `.so`.

```bash
# Build old library + app
g++ -shared -fPIC -g v1.cpp -o libsensor.so
g++ -g app.cpp -L. -lsensor -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# → sizeof(Sensor) = 16 (v1=16, v2=24)
# → id    = 7 (expected 7)
# → value = 98.6 (expected 98.6)

# Swap in new library (no recompile)
g++ -shared -fPIC -g v2.cpp -o libsensor.so
./app
# → sizeof(Sensor) = 16 (v1=16, v2=24)       ← app thinks 16, reality is 24
# → id    = 1717986918 (expected 7)           ← reads value_ bytes as int!
# → value = 0.0 (expected 98.6)              ← reads vtable pointer as double!
# → CORRUPTION: id_ at v1 offset 8 reads v2's value_ field!
# → CORRUPTION: value_ at v1 offset 0 reads v2's vtable pointer!
```

**Why CRITICAL:** The app accesses `s->value_` at v1 offset 0, but v2 placed
the vtable pointer there — the app reads an address as a `double`, getting 0.0
or garbage. The app accesses `s->id_` at v1 offset 8, but v2 placed `value_`
(98.6) there — interpreting the double's bytes as an `int` yields 1717986918.
For heap-allocated objects the library created a 24-byte object correctly, but
the app's direct field access uses v1 offsets and reads the wrong data.

## How to fix

1. **Design for virtuality from the start**: if a class might ever need virtual
   methods, add a virtual destructor in v1 to reserve the vtable pointer slot
2. **Use the Pimpl idiom**: hide the implementation behind a pointer to avoid
   exposing the class layout
3. **Use C-style opaque handles**: `typedef struct Sensor Sensor;` with factory
   functions — sizeof is never exposed
4. **SONAME bump**: if virtual methods must be added, bump the major version

## Real-world example

Qt's `QObject` has been virtual since Qt 1.0 specifically to avoid this problem.
The Qt ABI guidelines explicitly state: "never add a virtual function to a class
that previously had none."

The KDE Frameworks ABI policy documents this as one of the "cardinal sins" of
ABI breakage, requiring a SONAME bump if violated.

The Chromium project's Blink engine has encountered this when refactoring DOM
classes — adding virtuality to `Node` subclasses required rebuilding all
downstream components.

## abicheck detection

abicheck detects this primarily as `func_virtual_added` (BREAKING) — a virtual
method was introduced to a class that previously had none. Depending on the
analysis depth (DWARF-aware, header-aware), additional change kinds such as
`type_size_changed` and `type_vtable_changed` may also be reported, providing
further evidence of the vtable-insertion break.
