# Case 12: Function Removed from Shared Library

**Category:** Symbol API | **Abicheck verdict:** BREAKING | **Verdict:** 🔴 BREAKING

## What breaks
Any binary dynamically linked against v1 will fail to load with
`undefined symbol: fast_add` when upgraded to v2. The `.so` no longer exports
the symbol, so pre-built binaries have nowhere to resolve it. Even if the function
were moved to a header as an inline, already-compiled binaries cannot benefit from
that — they need the dynamic symbol.

## Why abidiff catches it
Reports `1 Removed function: fast_add` with exit **12** (breaking removal).

## Code diff

| v1.c | v2.c |
|------|------|
| `int fast_add(int a, int b) { return a+b; }` | *(function removed from .so)* |
| | `int other_func(int x) { return x; }` |

## Reproduce manually
```bash
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v1.c -o libfoo_v1.so
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v2.c -o libfoo_v2.so
abidw --out-file v1.xml libfoo_v1.so
abidw --out-file v2.xml libfoo_v2.so
abidiff v1.xml v2.xml
echo "exit: $?"   # → 12
```

## How to fix
Keep the exported wrapper in the `.so` even if the implementation moves to an inline.
The wrapper can simply call the inline: `int fast_add(int a, int b) { return _fast_add_impl(a,b); }`.
Only remove it on a SONAME-bumping major release.

## Real-world example
Several C++ standard library implementors have moved functions to inlines for
performance and then had to keep exported stubs for ABI compatibility — libstdc++'s
`std::string` refactor in GCC 5 is the canonical cautionary tale.

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: CRITICAL**

**Scenario:** app calls `fast_add()` compiled against v1. v2 removes it from the `.so`.

```bash
# Build v1 + app
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v1.c -o libfoo.so
gcc -g app.c -I. -L. -lfoo -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# → fast_add(3, 4) = 7
# → other_func(5)  = 5

# Swap in v2 (fast_add gone from .so)
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v2.c -o libfoo.so
./app
# → ./app: symbol lookup error: ./app: undefined symbol: fast_add
```

**Why CRITICAL:** With default lazy binding (RTLD_LAZY), the error surfaces on the
**first call** through the PLT — the app starts but immediately dies when `fast_add`
is called. With `LD_BIND_NOW=1` or `RTLD_NOW`, it fails at load time. Either way,
every binary that ever called `fast_add` is broken until recompiled against v2 headers.

## Why runtime result may differ from verdict
Function removed from .so — undefined symbol at runtime
