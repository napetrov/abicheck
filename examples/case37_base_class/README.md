# Case 37 -- Base Class Changes


**Verdict:** 🔴 BREAKING
**abicheck verdict: BREAKING**

## What changes

| Version | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| v1 | `ReorderDemo : Logger, Serializer` / `VirtualDemo : Logger` / `AddBaseDemo : Logger` |
| v2 | `ReorderDemo : Serializer, Logger` (swapped) / `VirtualDemo : virtual Logger` / `AddBaseDemo : Logger, Serializer` (added base) |

Three separate scenarios are demonstrated:

1. **Base class position changed** -- `ReorderDemo` swaps base order
2. **Base class became virtual** -- `VirtualDemo` gains `virtual` inheritance
3. **Base class added** -- `AddBaseDemo` acquires `Serializer` as a second base

## Why this is a binary ABI break

All three changes alter the object layout:

1. **Reorder:** In multiple inheritance, each base class occupies a sub-object at a
   specific offset. Swapping the order changes which vtable pointer is at offset 0
   and how `this` is adjusted when casting to a base pointer. Code compiled against v1
   that casts `ReorderDemo*` to `Logger*` will get the wrong sub-object with v2.

2. **Virtual inheritance:** Changing from non-virtual to virtual inheritance completely
   restructures the object layout, introducing a vbase offset and moving the base
   sub-object to the end of the most-derived object.

3. **Added base:** Adding `Serializer` as a base increases the object size and shifts
   field offsets. Code compiled with v1's layout will read/write wrong memory locations.

## Code diff

```diff
-class ReorderDemo : public Logger, public Serializer {
+class ReorderDemo : public Serializer, public Logger {
     // base order swapped -> this-pointer adjustments change

-class VirtualDemo : public Logger {
+class VirtualDemo : public virtual Logger {
     // non-virtual -> virtual inheritance -> layout restructured

-class AddBaseDemo : public Logger {
+class AddBaseDemo : public Logger, public Serializer {
     // new base added -> object size grows, offsets shift
```

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: CRITICAL**

```bash
# Build v1 lib + app
g++ -shared -fPIC -g v1.cpp -o libv1.so
g++ -g app.cpp -I. -L. -lv1 -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# -> ReorderDemo: log_level=1, format=2
# -> ReorderDemo::log() called via Logger* OK
# -> ReorderDemo::serialize() called via Serializer* OK
# -> VirtualDemo: log_level=5
# -> AddBaseDemo: log_level=3

# Swap to v2
g++ -shared -fPIC -g v2.cpp -o libv1.so
./app
# -> CRASH or wrong output: Logger* now points to Serializer sub-object
#    due to swapped base order. Virtual method calls through base pointers
#    invoke the wrong function or pass a corrupted this pointer.
```

**Why CRITICAL:** Base class layout changes silently corrupt the object's memory layout.
The `this`-pointer adjustments compiled into the application no longer match the
library's actual object layout, causing virtual dispatch to call the wrong function,
or field accesses to read/write the wrong memory -- both leading to crashes or
silent data corruption.

## Why runtime result may differ from verdict
Base class position changed: derived class layout corrupted

## Runtime note
Methods now mutate fields and app asserts expected postconditions; layout/base-order mismatch is observable.

## abicheck Detection

abicheck detects base class changes when run with header files (`-H`):

```bash
make  # builds libv1.so and libv2.so with -g debug info

python3 -m abicheck.cli dump libv1.so -H v1.hpp -o v1.json
python3 -m abicheck.cli dump libv2.so -H v2.hpp -o v2.json
python3 -m abicheck.cli compare v1.json v2.json
# → BREAKING: type_base_changed, type_size_changed, type_vtable_changed
```

**Note:** Without `-H` header files, abicheck reports NO_CHANGE because the ELF
symbol table does not encode C++ class hierarchy information. Header analysis is
required for C++ structural changes (base class composition, vtable layout, field
offsets).
