# Case 70: Flexible Array Member Element Type Changed

**Category:** Type Layout | **Verdict:** BREAKING

## What breaks

The element type of the flexible array member (FAM) `data[]` changes from
`float` (4 bytes) to `double` (8 bytes). This causes multiple ABI breaks:

1. **Allocation size:** Callers that allocated `sizeof(Packet) + count * sizeof(float)`
   now have **half the space** needed for `double` elements
2. **Element access:** `p->data[i]` reads 8 bytes per element instead of 4 — even
   indices overlap, odd indices read into uninitialized memory
3. **Return type:** `packet_sum()` changes from `float` to `double`, read from
   different register width

This is fundamentally different from fixed-size struct changes (case07, case14)
because the FAM has **zero static size** in `sizeof(Packet)` — the struct header
size is unchanged. Tools that only compare `sizeof` miss this entirely. The break
is in the dynamically-allocated tail portion.

It's also different from case45 (multi-dim array change) because a FAM has no
compile-time bound — the length is determined at runtime, making the allocation
mismatch especially dangerous.

## Why abicheck catches it

Header comparison detects that `Packet::data[]` changed element type from `float`
to `double` (`flexible_array_member_changed`). The function `packet_sum` also
changes return type (`func_return_changed`). Both are flagged as BREAKING.

## Code diff

```c
// v1: float elements (4 bytes each)
struct Packet {
    unsigned int id;
    unsigned int count;
    float data[];
};
float packet_sum(const struct Packet *p);

// v2: double elements (8 bytes each)
struct Packet {
    unsigned int id;
    unsigned int count;
    double data[];
};
double packet_sum(const struct Packet *p);
```

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: CRITICAL**

**Scenario:** compile app against v1, swap in v2 `.so` without recompile.

```bash
# Build v1 and app
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v1.c -o libpacket.so
gcc -g app.c -L. -lpacket -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# -> packet_sum = 10.0
# -> Expected: 10.0

# Swap in v2 (FAM element type changed)
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v2.c -o libpacket.so
./app
# -> packet_sum = <garbage> (buffer underallocation + type mismatch)
```

**Why CRITICAL:** The old binary calls `packet_create(1, 4)` which now allocates
space for 4 doubles (32 bytes of FAM) but the pointer arithmetic in the old
binary still assumes 4-byte float elements. When `packet_sum()` reads `data[2]`
and `data[3]`, it reads beyond the allocation boundary of what the caller
expected, interpreting float bit patterns as doubles.

## How to fix

Use an opaque allocation API and accessor functions instead of exposing the FAM
directly:

```c
/* Safe: opaque packet — element type is hidden */
typedef struct Packet Packet;
Packet *packet_create(unsigned int id, unsigned int count);
float packet_get(const Packet *p, unsigned int index);  /* accessor */
```

If the FAM must be public, freeze the element type and add a new struct for the
new type:

```c
struct PacketF { unsigned int id, count; float data[]; };   /* keep */
struct PacketD { unsigned int id, count; double data[]; };   /* new */
```

## Real-world example

Flexible array members are common in network protocol implementations (packet
buffers), database engines (variable-length records), and audio/video codecs
(sample buffers). The Linux kernel's `struct sk_buff` and PostgreSQL's varlena
types use this pattern extensively. Changing the element type of a FAM is a
subtle break that has caused memory corruption bugs in these projects.

libabigail specifically tracks FAM changes because `sizeof(T)` stays the same —
only DWARF inspection of the trailing array element type reveals the break.
