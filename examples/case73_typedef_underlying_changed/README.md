# Case 73: Typedef Underlying Type Changed

**Category:** Type ABI | **Verdict:** BREAKING

## What breaks

The typedef `handle_t` changes from `int` (4 bytes) to `void*` (8 bytes on
x86-64). This changes:

1. **Size of the type**: sizeof(handle_t) goes from 4 to 8 bytes
2. **Register class**: `int` is passed in integer registers (`%edi`), while
   `void*` is also in integer registers but at different size (32-bit vs 64-bit)
3. **Struct layout**: any struct containing `handle_t` changes size and alignment
4. **Return value**: `handle_open()` returns 4 vs 8 bytes

Old binaries compiled against v1 treat `handle_t` as `int`. When v2 returns a
pointer value, the caller truncates it to 32 bits, losing the upper half of the
address. Passing this truncated value back to `handle_read()` or `handle_close()`
causes the library to dereference a corrupted pointer.

This is different from case10 (return type changed for a plain function) because
here a **typedef alias** is changed, which silently affects every function using
that typedef. ABICC specifically flags this as a typedef underlying type change.

## Why abicheck catches it

Header comparison detects that `handle_t`'s underlying type changed from `int` to
`void*` (`typedef_base_changed`). Every function using `handle_t` in its signature
inherits the break, but the root cause is a single typedef change.

## Code diff

| v1.h | v2.h |
|------|------|
| `typedef int handle_t;` | `typedef void *handle_t;` |

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: CRITICAL**

**Scenario:** compile app against v1, swap in v2 `.so` without recompile.

```bash
# Build v1 and app
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v1.c -o libhandle.so
gcc -g app.c -L. -lhandle -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# -> handle = 1
# -> read 4 bytes
# -> Done.

# Swap in v2 (handle_t is now void*)
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v2.c -o libhandle.so
./app
# -> handle = <truncated pointer as int> (upper 32 bits lost)
# -> Segfault or corruption when passing truncated handle back to library
```

**Why CRITICAL:** The old binary truncates the 8-byte pointer return to 4 bytes
(the caller was compiled to treat handle_t as int). When this truncated value
is passed to `handle_read()` or `handle_close()`, the library dereferences a
corrupt pointer, causing a segfault or heap corruption.

## How to fix

Design handles as opaque pointers from the start, or use a fixed-width integer
that is already the maximum needed size:

```c
/* Option 1: opaque pointer from the start */
typedef struct handle_impl *handle_t;

/* Option 2: use a large enough integer from day one */
#include <stdint.h>
typedef uintptr_t handle_t;  /* always 8 bytes on 64-bit */
```

If the change is unavoidable, bump the SONAME and provide a migration path.

## Real-world example

ABICC prominently detects typedef underlying type changes. This pattern occurs in
system libraries when handles evolve: POSIX `pid_t` has varied across platforms,
Windows `HANDLE` is `void*` but was historically `int` in some SDK versions, and
database client libraries sometimes widen handle types to support larger connection
pools.
