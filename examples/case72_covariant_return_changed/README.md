# Case 72: Covariant Return Type Changed

**Category:** VTable / Inheritance | **Verdict:** BREAKING

## What breaks

The class hierarchy changes: a new intermediate class `Drawable` is inserted
between `Shape` and `Circle`. This causes `Circle::clone()` to change its
covariant return type from `Circle*` to `Drawable*`.

Under the Itanium C++ ABI, inserting an intermediate base class changes:

1. **Vtable layout**: `Drawable` introduces new vtable entries (its own virtual
   functions and RTTI), shifting existing `Shape` vtable slot positions
2. **Object layout**: `Circle`'s data members move to accommodate the `Drawable`
   subobject, changing field offsets and `sizeof(Circle)`
3. **Covariant return type**: `clone()` now returns `Drawable*` instead of
   `Circle*`, so callers expecting `Circle*` get a mistyped pointer

Old binaries compiled against v1 have hardcoded vtable slot indices and field
offsets for the `Shape → Circle` hierarchy. In v2, the `Drawable` intermediate
class shifts everything, causing virtual dispatch to call the wrong function
and field accesses to read garbage.

This is distinct from case09 (vtable reorder within same hierarchy), case37
(base class type changed), and case38 (virtual methods added/removed). This case
tests **hierarchy insertion** — adding a class between existing base and derived —
which is a particularly common real-world mistake.

## Why abicheck catches it

Type comparison detects the base class hierarchy change (`type_base_changed`) and
the vtable layout change (`type_vtable_changed`). The function return type change
from `Circle*` to `Drawable*` is also detected (`func_return_changed`).

## Code diff

```cpp
// v1: flat hierarchy
class Circle : public Shape {
    Circle *clone() const override;  // covariant: returns Circle*
};

// v2: intermediate class inserted, covariant return changes
class Drawable : public Shape { /* new */ };
class Circle : public Drawable {
    Drawable *clone() const override;  // covariant: returns Drawable*
};
```

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: CRITICAL**

**Scenario:** compile app against v1, swap in v2 `.so` without recompile.

```bash
# Build v1 and app
g++ -shared -fPIC -g v1.cpp -o libshape.so
g++ -g app.cpp -L. -lshape -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# -> clone radius = 5
# -> Expected: 5
# -> clone area = 75
# -> Expected: 75

# Build v2 (hierarchy changed, covariant return changed)
g++ -shared -fPIC -g v2.cpp -o libshape.so
./app
# -> crash or garbage (vtable layout shifted by Drawable insertion)
```

**Why CRITICAL:** The old binary's vtable for `Circle` was compiled with slot
indices for the two-level hierarchy `Shape → Circle`. In v2, `Drawable` is
inserted between them, adding new vtable entries and shifting slot positions.
Old code dispatching through stale vtable indices calls the wrong function.
Additionally, `sizeof(Circle)` changes due to the `Drawable` subobject, so
the `clone()` return value points to an object with a different layout than
the caller expects.

## How to fix

Never insert classes into an existing hierarchy without bumping the SONAME.
If the hierarchy must evolve, use composition instead of inheritance:

```cpp
/* Safe: composition instead of hierarchy insertion */
class Circle : public Shape {
    Drawable drawable_;  /* has-a instead of is-a */
    Circle *clone() const override;  /* covariant return unchanged */
};
```

Or freeze the public hierarchy and use internal delegation:

```cpp
/* Preserve public ABI, change implementation */
class Circle : public Shape {  /* public hierarchy frozen */
    Circle *clone() const override;
private:
    struct Impl;  /* internal hierarchy changes hidden */
    Impl *impl_;
};
```

## Real-world example

Qt's class hierarchy is carefully designed to never insert intermediate classes
in public hierarchies. The KDE Binary Compatibility policy explicitly forbids
this. The COM/XPCOM interface model avoids this entirely by using flat interface
inheritance. LLVM's RTTI system (`isa<>`, `dyn_cast<>`) would break if class
hierarchies changed because the classof() chain encodes the exact hierarchy.
