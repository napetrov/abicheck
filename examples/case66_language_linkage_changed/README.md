# Case 66: Language Linkage Changed (extern "C" removed)

**Category:** Function ABI | **Verdict:** BREAKING

## What breaks

The `extern "C"` wrapper is removed from the public header. In v1, functions are
exported with **C linkage** — the symbol name in the `.dynsym` table is exactly
`parse_config`. In v2, functions use **C++ linkage** — the exported symbol name
is mangled to something like `_Z12parse_configPKc`.

Any consumer (C or C++) that was linked against v1 has recorded `parse_config`
(unmangled) as the needed symbol. When v2 is loaded, that symbol doesn't exist —
the dynamic linker fails with "undefined symbol".

## Why this matters

`extern "C"` is the standard mechanism for C++ libraries to provide a C-compatible
ABI. It suppresses C++ name mangling, making symbols accessible from C code and
stable across different C++ compilers/versions. Removing it is equivalent to
renaming every affected function.

This break is particularly insidious because:
- The **source code compiles fine** with the new headers (C++ callers don't notice)
- The function **signatures are identical** — same name, same parameters
- The break is only visible in the **binary symbol table** (`nm -D`)
- C consumers cannot call the function at all (mangled names aren't valid C identifiers)

## Code diff

```cpp
// v1.h — C linkage (symbol: "parse_config")
extern "C" {
    int parse_config(const char *path);
}

// v2.h — C++ linkage (symbol: "_Z12parse_configPKc")
int parse_config(const char *path);
```

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: CRITICAL**

**Scenario:** compile C app against v1, swap in v2 `.so` without recompile.

```bash
# Build v1 (extern "C") and app
g++ -shared -fPIC -g v1.cpp -o libparser.so
gcc -g app.c -L. -lparser -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# → parse_config = 1 (expected 1)
# → validate_config = 1 (expected 1)

# Verify v1 exports unmangled names
nm -D libparser.so | grep parse_config
# → T parse_config
# → T validate_config

# Build v2 (no extern "C")
g++ -shared -fPIC -g v2.cpp -o libparser.so

# Verify v2 exports mangled names
nm -D libparser.so | grep parse_config
# → T _Z12parse_configPKc
# → T _Z15validate_configPKc

./app
# → ./app: symbol lookup error: ./app: undefined symbol: parse_config
```

**Why CRITICAL:** The unmangled symbol `parse_config` no longer exists in v2's
dynamic symbol table. The C++ mangled version `_Z12parse_configPKc` is there,
but the pre-linked binary doesn't know about it. Process killed at load time.

## How to fix

Always maintain `extern "C"` for public C-compatible APIs:

1. **Keep the extern "C" block**: this is a public API contract, not an implementation detail
2. **Use a C header**: keep the public header as pure C (`parser.h`) and use a
   separate C++ header for C++ consumers
3. **Enforce with CI**: add a check that all public `.dynsym` symbols match expected
   names (e.g., `nm -D libparser.so | grep -v '^_Z'` should list all public functions)

## Real-world example

This commonly happens during "modernization" refactors when a C library is
rewritten in C++. The developer removes `extern "C"` thinking "we're C++ now"
without realizing that all downstream C consumers (and pre-built C++ binaries)
depend on the unmangled names.

libpng, zlib, and SQLite all maintain `extern "C"` blocks specifically to
ensure their C ABI contract is preserved even when compiled as C++.

## abicheck detection

abicheck detects this as `func_language_linkage_changed` (BREAKING) by
comparing symbol names in the dynamic symbol table — the unmangled name
disappears and a mangled name appears, which is flagged as a linkage change
rather than a simple removal + addition.
