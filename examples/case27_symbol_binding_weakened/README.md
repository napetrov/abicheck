# Case 27 — Symbol Binding Weakened (GLOBAL → WEAK)


**Verdict:** 🟢 COMPATIBLE
**abicheck verdict: COMPATIBLE (informational/warning)**

## What changes

| Version | ELF binding |
|---------|------------|
| v1 | `foo: GLOBAL DEFAULT` |
| v2 | `foo: WEAK DEFAULT` |

This typically happens when a library applies `__attribute__((weak))` to a previously
strong (GLOBAL) symbol, or when a linker script changes binding.

## Why this is NOT a binary ABI break

A WEAK symbol is still **exported and resolvable** by the dynamic linker. Existing
binaries that linked against the GLOBAL version of `foo` will find and use the
(now WEAK) symbol without any change in behavior.

abicheck classifies this as **COMPATIBLE** because:
- The symbol is still present in `.dynsym` and resolvable.
- No calling convention, type layout, or signature change occurs.
- The dynamic linker resolves WEAK symbols the same way as GLOBAL when no
  override is present.

## What it does affect

- **Symbol interposition**: a WEAK symbol can be overridden by a GLOBAL definition
  from another shared object or the main executable. If the consumer's environment
  provides an alternative definition, the WEAK version may not be used.
- **Linker behavior**: some linkers treat WEAK symbols differently during static
  linking (e.g., not pulling the object file from an archive).

These are deployment/interposition concerns, not binary compatibility failures.

## Contrast with BREAKING binding changes

The reverse direction — WEAK → GLOBAL (`SYMBOL_BINDING_STRENGTHENED`) — is also
classified as COMPATIBLE. Neither direction breaks existing symbol resolution.

## Code diff

```diff
 /* v1: normal definition */
-int foo(void) { return 42; }
+__attribute__((weak)) int foo(void) { return 42; }
```

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: INFORMATIONAL**

**Scenario:** app calls `foo()`. Both GLOBAL and WEAK versions return 42 — no runtime difference.

```bash
# Build old lib (GLOBAL foo) + app
gcc -shared -fPIC -g old/lib.c -Iold -o libfoo.so
gcc -g app.c -Iold -L. -lfoo -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# → foo() = 42

# Swap in new lib (WEAK foo)
gcc -shared -fPIC -g new/lib.c -Inew -o libfoo.so
./app
# → foo() = 42  ← same result

# Difference shows in ELF symbol binding:
readelf --syms libfoo.so | grep foo
# old: GLOBAL DEFAULT  foo
# new: WEAK   DEFAULT  foo
```

**Why INFORMATIONAL:** WEAK symbols are still exported and resolved normally when no
override exists. The concern is interposition: if another `.so` or the executable
defines `foo` as GLOBAL, the WEAK version will be silently overridden at runtime.

## Why runtime is COMPATIBLE (matches verdict)
WEAK symbols are still exported and resolved normally when no override exists. The concern is interposition — another `.so` defining the symbol as GLOBAL silently overrides it. In this demo no override exists, so runtime behavior is identical to GLOBAL binding.
