# Case 67: TLS Variable Size Changed

**Category:** Variable ABI | **Verdict:** BREAKING

## What breaks

The thread-local `ErrorCtx` struct grows from 68 bytes (v1) to 72 bytes (v2)
because a new `severity` field is inserted between `code` and `message`. This
shifts `message` from offset 4 to offset 8.

A consumer compiled against v1 accesses `tls_error.message` at offset 4, but
v2 wrote the `severity` integer there. The app reads the integer bytes as a
string — getting garbage or an empty string instead of the error message.

## Why this matters

Thread-local variables (`__thread` / `thread_local`) are commonly used for
per-thread error state, logging context, and locale data. When exported as part
of a library's public ABI, the **struct layout** of TLS variables becomes a
binary contract:

- Consumers that access struct fields directly (not through accessor functions)
  embed the field offsets at compile time
- Changing the struct layout changes the ELF symbol size (`st_size` in `.dynsym`)
  which abicheck tracks
- The corruption is **per-thread** and hard to reproduce in testing because each
  thread gets its own TLS copy

This break is particularly dangerous because:
- TLS variables are often accessed on hot paths (error checking, logging)
- The struct may be large (message buffers, context data)
- Inserting a field is a natural "improvement" that seems harmless

## Code diff

```c
// v1: message at offset 4
typedef struct ErrorCtx {
    int   code;          /* offset 0 */
    char  message[64];   /* offset 4 */
} ErrorCtx;  /* sizeof = 68 */

// v2: severity inserted, message shifts to offset 8
typedef struct ErrorCtx {
    int   code;          /* offset 0 (unchanged) */
    int   severity;      /* offset 4 (NEW!) */
    char  message[64];   /* offset 8 (was 4 — shifted!) */
} ErrorCtx;  /* sizeof = 72 */
```

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: CRITICAL**

**Scenario:** compile app against v1, swap in v2 `.so` without recompile.

```bash
# Build old library + app
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v1.c -o liblogger.so
gcc -g app.c -L. -llogger -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# → error code = 404 (expected 404)
# → message = "not found" (expected "not found")

# Swap in new library (no recompile)
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v2.c -o liblogger.so
./app
# → error code = 404 (expected 404)
# → message = "\x03" (expected "not found")   ← reads severity=3 as a char!
# → CORRUPTION: TLS struct layout changed
```

**Why CRITICAL:** The app reads `tls_error.message` at v1's offset 4, but v2
placed the `severity` integer (value 3) there. On little-endian x86, the app
interprets bytes `0x03 0x00 0x00 0x00` as a 1-character string `"\x03"` (a
non-printable control character). The actual message `"not found"` is at
offset 8, which the app never reads. No crash occurs — just silently wrong
error messages, making debugging extremely difficult.

## How to fix

1. **Use accessor functions**: don't export TLS variables directly; provide
   `logger_get_message()` / `logger_set_message()` instead
2. **Append-only layout**: only add new fields at the end of the struct, never
   insert between existing fields
3. **Use opaque pointers**: `extern __thread void *tls_error_ctx;` with accessor
   functions that cast internally
4. **Freeze exported struct layout**: treat the `sizeof` and field offsets of
   any exported TLS variable as part of the ABI contract
5. **Add reserved space**: include padding fields for future expansion

## Real-world example

glibc's `errno` is a TLS variable (`__thread int errno`). Its size (4 bytes)
has been frozen since glibc 2.0 — changing it would break every C program in
existence. Similarly, `__thread locale_t __locale` in glibc has a fixed layout
that cannot change without breaking the ABI.

OpenSSL's per-thread error queue used to be a public TLS struct; OpenSSL 3.0
moved to an opaque handle specifically to avoid this class of break when the
error context needed to grow.

## abicheck detection

abicheck detects this as `tls_var_size_changed` (BREAKING) by comparing the
`st_size` field in the `.dynsym` entry for TLS symbols (those with `STT_TLS`
type) between the two library versions.
