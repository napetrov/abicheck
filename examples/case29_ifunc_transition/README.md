# Case 29 — GNU IFUNC Transition


**Verdict:** 🟢 COMPATIBLE
**abicheck verdict: COMPATIBLE (informational/warning)**

## What changes

| Version | ELF symbol type |
|---------|----------------|
| v1 | `dispatch: STT_FUNC` (regular function) |
| v2 | `dispatch: STT_GNU_IFUNC` (indirect function) |

## What is GNU IFUNC?

GNU IFUNC (indirect function) is a mechanism for runtime CPU dispatch. Instead of
pointing directly to the function body, the symbol points to a **resolver function**
that returns the address of the best implementation for the current CPU. The dynamic
linker calls the resolver at load time and patches the GOT entry.

Common uses:
- glibc's `memcpy`, `strlen`, etc. use IFUNC to select SSE/AVX/NEON implementations.
- Math libraries dispatch to architecture-specific code paths.

## Why this is NOT a binary ABI break

The transition from regular function to IFUNC (or back) is **transparent to callers**.
The PLT/GOT mechanism handles the indirection automatically:

1. Caller calls `dispatch()` through the PLT (same as before).
2. Dynamic linker resolves the symbol — if IFUNC, calls the resolver first.
3. GOT entry is patched with the final function address.
4. All subsequent calls go directly to the resolved address.

abicheck classifies this as **COMPATIBLE** because:
- The calling convention is unchanged.
- The function signature is unchanged.
- Symbol resolution succeeds transparently.
- This is purely an implementation optimization.

## What it does affect

- **Debugger behavior**: breakpoints on IFUNC symbols may behave differently
  (breakpoint hits the resolver on first call, then the resolved implementation).
- **Static analysis tools**: may not recognize the indirection.
- **Older dynamic linkers**: very old ld.so versions may not support IFUNC
  (but this is a deployment concern, not an ABI contract issue).

## Code diff

```diff
-int dispatch(int x) { return x * 2; }
+static int dispatch_generic(int x) { return x * 2; }
+
+/* IFUNC resolver — called by dynamic linker at load time */
+static int (*resolve_dispatch(void))(int) { return dispatch_generic; }
+int dispatch(int x) __attribute__((ifunc("resolve_dispatch")));
```

> In production, the resolver would typically select between multiple implementations
> (e.g., generic vs AVX) based on CPU feature detection. This example uses a single
> implementation for simplicity.

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: INFORMATIONAL**

**Scenario:** app calls `dispatch(5)`. Both regular function and IFUNC return 10 transparently.

```bash
# Build old lib (regular function) + app
gcc -shared -fPIC -g old/lib.c -Iold -o libdispatch.so
gcc -g app.c -Iold -L. -ldispatch -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# → dispatch(5) = 10 (expected 10)

# Swap in new lib (GNU IFUNC — resolver picks implementation at load time)
gcc -shared -fPIC -g new/lib.c -Inew -o libdispatch.so
./app
# → dispatch(5) = 10 (expected 10)  ← identical result
```

**Why INFORMATIONAL:** The PLT/GOT mechanism handles IFUNC resolution transparently.
The caller uses the same call site; the dynamic linker calls the resolver once at
load time and patches the GOT entry. Only edge cases differ: debugger breakpoints
may hit the resolver first, and very old `ld.so` versions may not support IFUNC.

## Why runtime result may differ from verdict
IFUNC: PLT/GOT transparent to caller, runtime compat
