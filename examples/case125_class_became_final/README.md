# Case 125 — Class Became `final`

**Verdict:** 🟠 API_BREAK
**abicheck verdict: API_BREAK** (with headers) / **NO_CHANGE** (object/ELF-only)

## What changes

| Version | Declaration |
|---------|-------------|
| v1 | `class Shape { ... };` |
| v2 | `class Shape final { ... };` |

The class gains the `final` specifier. Its size, alignment, vtable and the
mangled names of all its members are **unchanged**.

## What breaks

Any consumer that derives from `Shape` (`struct MyShape : public Shape`) no
longer compiles against v2 — `error: cannot derive from 'final' base`. See
`app.cpp`, which compiles against v1.h and fails against v2.h. Already-compiled
binaries keep linking and running (the ABI is identical), so this is a pure
**source / API break**, not a runtime ABI break.

## Why this case exists — a change no object inspection can detect

`final` is a C++ source-level specifier. It is **not recorded in DWARF, in the
symbol table, or anywhere in the object file** — the v1 and v2 `.so` files are
ABI-identical. A tool that compares only binaries (or stripped/DWARF-only
builds) **cannot** detect this change, and reports `NO_CHANGE`.

abicheck catches it **only in header mode**, where castxml parses the
declaration and records the `final` class-key (`ChangeKind` `type_became_final`).
This case demonstrates why source/header analysis — not just object comparison
— is required for the full API picture. See
[Limitations → Source-only changes](../../docs/concepts/limitations.md).

## Reproduce manually
```bash
g++ -shared -fPIC -g v1.cpp -o libshape_v1.so
g++ -shared -fPIC -g v2.cpp -o libshape_v2.so

# Header mode — detected:
abicheck compare libshape_v1.so libshape_v2.so \
    --old-header v1.h --new-header v2.h        # → API_BREAK (type_became_final)

# Object-only mode — invisible:
abicheck compare libshape_v1.so libshape_v2.so # → NO_CHANGE
```

## How to fix
Keep public base classes non-`final`, or document the inheritance contract.
Adding `final` to a previously-extensible public class is a breaking API change
and warrants a major version bump.
