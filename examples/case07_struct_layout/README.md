# Case 07: Struct Layout Change

**Category:** Type Layout | **Verdict:** 🟡 ABI CHANGE (exit 4)

> **Note on abidiff 2.4.0:** Struct layout changes return exit **4** (not 12),
> but the change is **semantically breaking** — all callers allocate the old size
> and pass wrong-length data.

## What breaks
Code compiled against v1 allocates `sizeof(Point) = 8` bytes. v2's `Point` is 12
bytes. Stack/heap allocations are undersized; the `z` field reads/writes outside the
allocated region. Any binary passing `Point` by value is broken without recompilation.

## Why abidiff catches it
Reports `type size changed from 64 to 96 (in bits)` and `1 data member insertion`.

## Code diff

| v1.c | v2.c |
|------|------|
| `struct Point { int x; int y; };` | `struct Point { int x; int y; int z; };` |

## Reproduce manually
```bash
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v1.c -o libfoo_v1.so
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v2.c -o libfoo_v2.so
abidw --out-file v1.xml libfoo_v1.so
abidw --out-file v2.xml libfoo_v2.so
abidiff v1.xml v2.xml
echo "exit: $?"   # → 4
```

## How to fix
Never add fields to public structs. Use the opaque-pointer (PIMPL) idiom: expose
`struct Point*` and allocate/free through library functions, so the struct layout
is hidden from callers.

## Real-world example
The C standard library's `FILE*` is a classic opaque handle — callers never see
the struct layout; all access is through `fopen`/`fread`/`fclose`. This pattern
keeps the ABI stable across libc versions even as the internal `FILE` struct changes.

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: CRITICAL**

**Scenario:** app allocates `Point` with v1 layout (8 bytes), calls `init_point()` from v2 which writes a `z` field at offset 8 — past the allocation.

```bash
# Build v1 + app (use -O0 to ensure predictable stack layout for canary demo)
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v1.c -o libfoo.so
gcc -g -O0 app.c -I. -L. -lfoo -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# → before: p={0,0} canary=0xDEADBEEF
# → after:  p={1,2} canary=0xDEADBEEF

# Swap in v2 (no recompile)
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v2.c -o libfoo.so
./app
# → before: p={0,0} canary=0xDEADBEEF
# → after:  p={1,2} canary=0x00000003   ← CORRUPTED
# → CORRUPTION detected! (v2 wrote past end of struct)
```

**Why CRITICAL:** The v2 library writes a `z` field at byte offset 8, but the app only
allocated 8 bytes for the struct. The canary variable on the stack is overwritten —
a classic stack corruption that can corrupt control flow or cause silent data loss.
