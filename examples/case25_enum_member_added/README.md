# Case 25 — Enum Member Added


**Verdict:** 🟢 COMPATIBLE
**abicheck verdict: COMPATIBLE (informational/warning)**

## What changes

| Version | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| v1 | `enum Color { RED = 0, GREEN = 1, BLUE = 2 };` |
| v2 | `enum Color { RED = 0, GREEN = 1, BLUE = 2, YELLOW = 3 };` |

## Why this is NOT a binary ABI break

Adding a new enum member at the end does **not** change the numeric values of existing
members. Already-compiled binaries continue to pass and receive `RED = 0`, `GREEN = 1`,
`BLUE = 2` — all unchanged.

abicheck classifies this as **COMPATIBLE** because:
- No existing enum values are shifted or reassigned.
- No symbol resolution, type layout, or calling convention change occurs.
- The binary representation of existing values is identical.

**Important:** If adding a member *shifts* existing values (e.g., inserting in the
middle without explicit values), that causes `ENUM_MEMBER_VALUE_CHANGED` which IS
classified as BREAKING.

## What it does affect (source-level concerns)

- **Switch statements**: code compiled against v1 may not handle `YELLOW`. The
  default branch (if any) will execute. This is a source-level correctness concern,
  not a binary compatibility issue.
- **Sentinel patterns**: if `BLUE` was used as `COLOR_COUNT` or `COLOR_MAX`, adding
  `YELLOW` changes the count semantics. This is also a source-level design concern.

## Contrast with BREAKING enum changes

| Change | Verdict | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Member **added** (values unchanged) | COMPATIBLE | Existing values stable |
| Member **removed** | BREAKING | Existing code references invalid value |
| Member **value changed** | BREAKING | Same name maps to different integer |

## Code diff

```diff
-enum Color { RED = 0, GREEN = 1, BLUE = 2 };
+enum Color { RED = 0, GREEN = 1, BLUE = 2, YELLOW = 3 };
```

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: INFORMATIONAL**

**Scenario:** app compiled with old header calls `get_color()`. BLUE is returned by both — no breakage.

```bash
# Build old lib + app
gcc -shared -fPIC -g old/lib.c -Iold -o libcolor.so
gcc -g app.c -Iold -L. -lcolor -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# → BLUE

# Swap in new lib (YELLOW added at end — existing values unchanged)
gcc -shared -fPIC -g new/lib.c -Inew -o libcolor.so
./app
# → BLUE  ← same result, no breakage
```

**Why INFORMATIONAL:** Adding enum members at the end does not shift existing values.
Old binaries continue to work correctly for known values. The concern is behavioral,
not binary: switch statements without a `YELLOW` case won't handle it at runtime —
if a new library returns `YELLOW`, old binaries fall through to `default` silently.

## Why runtime is COMPATIBLE (matches verdict)
Existing values are unchanged — old binaries never see the new `YELLOW` value unless the library starts returning it. Binary layout is identical. COMPATIBLE is the correct verdict.
