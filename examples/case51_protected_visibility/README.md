# Case 51: Protected Visibility (DEFAULT to PROTECTED)

**Category:** ELF / Policy | **Verdict:** 🟢 COMPATIBLE

## What changes

| Version | `hook_point` ELF visibility |
|---------|---------------------------|
| v1 | `STV_DEFAULT` — interposable via LD_PRELOAD or other .so |
| v2 | `STV_PROTECTED` — prevents interposition for references from within the defining shared object; does not affect external symbol resolution |

## Why this is NOT a binary ABI break

The symbol `hook_point` is still **exported and resolvable** in both versions.
Existing binaries that call `hook_point` will find it and get correct results.
No calling convention, type layout, or signature changes.

abicheck classifies this as **COMPATIBLE** because:
- The symbol remains in `.dynsym` and is resolvable.
- Function signature and behavior are unchanged.
- Standard callers (via PLT/GOT) are unaffected.

## What it does affect

- **Interposition is broken**: `LD_PRELOAD`-based tooling (sanitizers, profilers,
  mock libraries) that overrides `hook_point` will no longer intercept calls
  **made from within the library itself**. The library's own `compute()` will
  always call its local `hook_point`, ignoring any preloaded override.
- **Plugin/hook systems**: if consumers relied on overriding `hook_point` to
  customize library behavior, that contract is silently broken.
- **`-Bsymbolic` similarity**: PROTECTED visibility has similar semantics to
  linking with `-Bsymbolic` — internal references bind directly.

## Code diff

```diff
 /* v1: DEFAULT — interposable */
-int hook_point(int x) { return x * 2; }
+__attribute__((visibility("protected")))
+int hook_point(int x) { return x * 2; }
```

## How to reproduce

```bash
# Build both versions
gcc -shared -fPIC -g old/lib.c -Iold -o libv1.so
gcc -shared -fPIC -g new/lib.c -Inew -o libv2.so

# Check visibility
readelf --dyn-syms libv1.so | grep hook_point
# → DEFAULT  hook_point
readelf --dyn-syms libv2.so | grep hook_point
# → PROTECTED hook_point

# Run abicheck
python3 -m abicheck.cli dump libv1.so -o /tmp/v1.json
python3 -m abicheck.cli dump libv2.so -o /tmp/v2.json
python3 -m abicheck.cli compare /tmp/v1.json /tmp/v2.json
# → COMPATIBLE (visibility metadata change noted)
```

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: INFORMATIONAL**

**Scenario:** app calls `compute(5)`. Both versions return 11 — no runtime difference
for normal callers. The difference only surfaces with LD_PRELOAD interposition.

```bash
# Build old lib + app
gcc -shared -fPIC -g old/lib.c -Iold -o libfoo.so
gcc -g app.c -Iold -L. -lfoo -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# → hook_point(5) = 10
# → compute(5)    = 11

# Swap in new lib (PROTECTED hook_point)
gcc -shared -fPIC -g new/lib.c -Inew -o libfoo.so
./app
# → hook_point(5) = 10  ← same result
# → compute(5)    = 11  ← same result

# But with LD_PRELOAD override, behavior differs:
# v1: LD_PRELOAD hook overrides both direct calls AND calls from compute()
# v2: LD_PRELOAD hook overrides direct calls but NOT calls from within the library
```

**Why INFORMATIONAL:** Normal operation is identical. The concern is that
interposition-dependent workflows (profiling, mocking, hot-patching) are
silently broken for library-internal call paths.

## Why runtime is COMPATIBLE (matches verdict)

PROTECTED symbols are still exported and resolved normally for external callers.
The only behavioral change is in intra-library call resolution: the library
always uses its own definition, preventing interposition. For standard consumers
this is transparent.

## Real-world example

GCC's `-fno-semantic-interposition` flag assumes interposed implementations have
the same semantics — showing that interposition is part of the ELF semantic model.
Libraries that change from DEFAULT to PROTECTED visibility should document this
as an interposition policy change.
