# Case 64: Calling Convention Changed

**Category:** Function ABI | **Verdict:** BREAKING

## What breaks

The functions `vector_dot` and `vector_scale` change from the default System V
AMD64 calling convention to `__attribute__((ms_abi))` (Microsoft x64 convention).
This changes which CPU registers carry function parameters and return values:

| | System V ABI (v1) | Microsoft x64 ABI (v2) |
|---|---|---|
| Integer args | `rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`, `rcx`, `r8`, `r9` | `rcx`, `rdx`, `r8`, `r9` |
| Float args | `xmm0`–`xmm7` | `xmm0`–`xmm3` |
| Callee-saved | `rbx`, `rbp`, `r12`–`r15` | `rbx`, `rbp`, `rdi`, `rsi`, `r12`–`r15` |

A caller compiled against v1 passes `a` in `rdi`, `b` in `rsi`, `len` in `edx`.
The v2 function reads `a` from `rcx`, `b` from `rdx`, `len` from `r8d` — getting
whatever stale values those registers happen to hold.

## Why this matters

Calling conventions define the **fundamental contract** between caller and callee:
- Which registers hold which parameters
- How the return value is passed back
- Who saves/restores which registers (caller-saved vs callee-saved)
- Stack alignment requirements

When this contract is violated, the function operates on completely wrong data.
The result is either garbage output, a segfault (if a pointer parameter is wrong),
or silent data corruption.

This is particularly dangerous in math/compute libraries where:
- Performance-sensitive code may switch conventions for platform interop
- The library "works fine" when rebuilt from source — the bug only manifests with
  pre-compiled consumers

## Code diff

```c
/* v1: default System V AMD64 calling convention */
double vector_dot(const double *a, const double *b, int len);

/* v2: Microsoft x64 calling convention — different register assignment */
__attribute__((ms_abi))
double vector_dot(const double *a, const double *b, int len);
```

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: CRITICAL**

**Scenario:** compile app against v1, swap in v2 `.so` without recompile.

```bash
# Build old library + app
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v1.c -o libfoo.so
gcc -g app.c -L. -lfoo -Wl,-rpath,. -o app -lm
./app
# → dot product = 32.0 (expected 32.0)
# → scaled = {2.0, 4.0, 6.0} (expected {2.0, 4.0, 6.0})

# Swap in new library (no recompile)
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v2.c -o libfoo.so
./app
# → dot product = 0.0 (expected 32.0)
# → scaled = {0.0, 0.0, 0.0} (expected {2.0, 4.0, 6.0})
# → WRONG RESULT: calling convention mismatch — parameters passed in wrong registers!
```

**Why CRITICAL:** The v2 function expects pointer parameters in `rcx`/`rdx`
(ms_abi) but receives them in `rdi`/`rsi` (sysv_abi). The function reads from
registers that hold stale values (typically zero), producing garbage results.
With different register contents this could also cause a segfault if the stale
value is dereferenced as a pointer.

## How to fix

Never change the calling convention of an exported function. If a new convention
is needed:

1. **Add a new symbol**: `vector_dot_fast()` with the new convention
2. **Use a wrapper**: keep the old entry point as a thin wrapper that forwards to
   the optimized implementation
3. **Version the API**: provide `libmath_v2.so` with the new convention and a
   migration guide

## Real-world example

The Windows ecosystem has dealt with this extensively: `__stdcall` vs `__cdecl`
vs `__fastcall` vs `__vectorcall` have caused countless DLL compatibility issues.
The Win32 API froze on `__stdcall` specifically to prevent this class of break.

Wine (the Windows compatibility layer) must carefully match calling conventions
between Linux System V and Windows ms_abi for every thunked function — getting
even one wrong causes the exact crash demonstrated here.

Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL) uses `__cdecl` for its public API but internally
uses `__vectorcall` for SIMD-heavy routines — the public entry points are thin
wrappers that preserve the calling convention contract.

## abicheck detection

abicheck detects this as `calling_convention_changed` (BREAKING) by comparing
DWARF `DW_AT_calling_convention` attributes between the two binary versions.
