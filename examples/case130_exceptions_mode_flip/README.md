# Case 130: Exceptions Mode Flip (`-fno-exceptions`)

**Category:** Build mode | **Verdict:** 🟠 COMPATIBLE_WITH_RISK

> Same source, same exported symbols. The only difference is the **build mode**:
> v1 was built with C++ exceptions enabled (`-fexceptions`), v2 with
> `-fno-exceptions`. abicheck captures the per-side build context (L3) from a
> `compile_commands.json` and reports `exceptions_mode_changed`.

## What this demonstrates
The two modes are not link-compatible: an exception thrown in `-fexceptions`
code that unwinds through a frame compiled `-fno-exceptions` is undefined
behaviour, and `-fno-exceptions` changes the codegen / EH tables of every public
inline that uses `throw`/`try`/`catch`. A symbol-only or even DWARF-only check
sees nothing — the signal lives in the captured build flags.

## Why COMPATIBLE_WITH_RISK
Per ADR-028 D3 a build-context finding never decides a shipped-ABI break on its
own; the artifact diff proves any concrete break. This flags the elevated risk
and localizes the cause for review.

## How abicheck detects it
`v1.compile_commands.json` carries `-fexceptions`, `v2.compile_commands.json`
carries `-fno-exceptions`. The L3 build-evidence diff normalizes these to the
canonical `exceptions` option and reports the flip.

## Reproduce manually
```bash
g++ -shared -fPIC -g v1.cpp -o libv1.so
g++ -shared -fPIC -g v2.cpp -o libv2.so
abicheck dump libv1.so --build-info v1.compile_commands.json -o v1.abi.json
abicheck dump libv2.so --build-info v2.compile_commands.json -o v2.abi.json
abicheck compare v1.abi.json v2.abi.json   # → exceptions_mode_changed
```

## How to fix
Ship one exception mode for the public ABI, or rebuild all consumers in the
matching mode if the public API exposes exception types or throwing inlines.
