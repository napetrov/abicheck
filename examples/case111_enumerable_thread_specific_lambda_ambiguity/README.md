# Case 111: enumerable_thread_specific Lambda-Init Ambiguity

**Category:** Subtle source break / oneTBB regression suite | **Verdict:** 🟢 COMPATIBLE (known gap — see below)

## What breaks

A second constructor overload is added — `enumerable_thread_specific(std::function<int()>)`.
By itself this is a pure addition: existing call sites that pass an `int`
still resolve to the original constructor. But consumer code patterns
that previously had a single viable conversion path can now become
ambiguous, particularly with brace-initialization or generic callable
arguments. The risk is silent — code that compiled before may compile to
a different constructor against the new headers, or stop compiling at
unrelated call sites that infer the wrong overload.

## Why this is in the oneTBB regression suite

Mirrors a documented oneTBB pain point: adding lambda-/functor-accepting
constructor overloads to existing handle types introduced overload
ambiguity in real downstream code. The pattern is repeatable across
container-like types.

## How abicheck catches it (and where it doesn't)

The diff exposes:

- `FUNC_ADDED`: the new `std::function<int()>` constructor

`FUNC_ADDED` on a constructor is COMPATIBLE — by itself it cannot link-
or ABI-break anything. The follow-on **overload ambiguity** that breaks
downstream source compilation cannot be detected from snapshots alone:
it depends on the consumer's call-site context. This is a documented
**known_gap**.

Future work (see roadmap: case105 concept tightening) is the natural
home for "constructor overload set risk-classification" because both
need the castxml header-AST capture path to reason about call-site
resolvability.

## Code diff

| v1 | v2 |
|----|------|
| `enumerable_thread_specific(int);` | same — plus a new overload |
| (no other ctors) | `enumerable_thread_specific(std::function<int()>);` |

## How to fix (as a library maintainer)

- Constrain the lambda-init overload with a SFINAE / concept that
  excludes `int`-convertible types. e.g.:
  ```cpp
  template <class F,
            class = std::enable_if_t<!std::is_convertible_v<F, int>>>
  explicit enumerable_thread_specific(F&& init);
  ```
  This eliminates the ambiguity at the call site.
- Or expose the lambda-init as a named factory
  (`from_lambda(...)`) rather than as an overloaded constructor.
