# Case 36 -- Anonymous Struct/Union Change


**Verdict:** 🔴 BREAKING
**abicheck verdict: BREAKING**

## What changes

| Version | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| v1 | `struct Variant { int tag; union { int i; float f; }; };` (size 8) |
| v2 | `struct Variant { int tag; union { int i; double d; }; };` (size 16) |

## Why this is a binary ABI break

Changing `float f` to `double d` inside the anonymous union increases the union's
size from 4 bytes to 8 bytes. This changes the overall struct size from 8 to 16
bytes (with alignment padding). When the app allocates a `Variant` on the stack
using v1's sizeof (8 bytes), but the v2 library's functions expect 16-byte objects,
the mismatch can cause:

- Stack corruption if the library writes beyond the 8-byte allocation
- Wrong field offsets if the `i` member moves due to alignment changes
- Subtle data corruption in arrays of `Variant`

The demo makes this offset mismatch deterministic by embedding the `Variant` in
a buffer filled with sentinel bytes (0xAA). When v2's `variant_get_int()` reads
`v->i` at offset 8 instead of offset 4, it reads the sentinel bytes instead of
the actual value 42, producing a visibly wrong result every run.

## Code diff

```diff
 struct Variant {
     int tag;
     union {
         int    i;
-        float  f;    /* 4 bytes -> union size = 4 */
+        double d;    /* 8 bytes -> union size = 8, struct gains padding */
     };
 };
```

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: CRITICAL**

```bash
# Build v1 lib + app
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v1.c -o libv1.so
gcc -g app.c -I. -L. -lv1 -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# -> sizeof(Variant) = 8 (compiled against v1)
# -> tag = 1, i = 42
# -> variant_get_int() = 42

# Swap to v2
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v2.c -o libv1.so
./app
# -> sizeof(Variant) = 8 (compiled against v1)    <-- app still uses v1's size!
# -> tag = 1, i = 42
# -> variant_get_int() = -1431655766               <-- WRONG! (0xAAAAAAAA sentinel)
# -> ERROR: expected 42, got -1431655766 — ABI layout mismatch!
#      v2's variant_get_int() read 'i' at offset 8 instead of 4
#      (sentinel bytes 0xAA were read instead of the actual value)
```

**Why CRITICAL:** The struct size changed from 8 to 16 bytes. The `double`
member in v2's anonymous union forces 8-byte alignment, shifting `v->i` from
offset 4 to offset 8. Reading `v->i` via `variant_get_int()` is already
undefined behavior due to the layout change — the demo makes this visible by
using sentinel-filled buffers so the wrong offset read produces a deterministic
incorrect value.

## Why runtime result may differ from verdict
Anon struct layout change: field offsets shift without DWARF, silent corruption

## Runtime note
App returns non-zero on detected offset mismatch.
