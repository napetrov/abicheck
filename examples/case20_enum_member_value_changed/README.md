# Case 20 — Enum Member Value Changed


**Verdict:** 🔴 BREAKING
**Verdict detail:** ABI break (runtime value mismatch) + API break (enum value changed in header)
**abicheck verdict: BREAKING**

## What changes

| Version | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| v1 | `enum ErrorCode { OK = 0, ERROR = 1 };` |
| v2 | `enum ErrorCode { OK = 0, ERROR = 99 };` |

## What breaks at binary level

Changing the numeric value of an enum member is a **semantic ABI break**. Existing
binaries were compiled with `ERROR = 1` and will pass, store, and compare that value.
The new library interprets `ERROR` as `99` — the same symbolic name now maps to a
different integer.

This is effectively a protocol rewrite without version negotiation. Components built
against different versions will exchange the same integer and interpret it with
opposite semantics.

## Consumer impact

```c
/* consumer compiled against v1 */
if (result == ERROR) { /* ERROR = 1 */ }

/* with v2 library, ERROR = 99 */
/* consumer checks for value 1, library returns 99 */
/* error condition is silently missed */
```

## Mitigation

- Never reassign released enum numeric values.
- Append new constants instead of renumbering.
- Introduce explicit protocol versioning for cross-version communication.

## Code diff

```diff
-enum ErrorCode { OK = 0, ERROR = 1 };
+enum ErrorCode { OK = 0, ERROR = 99 };
```

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: CRITICAL**

**Scenario:** app compiled with old header (`ERROR=1`) checks the return value. v2 library now returns `99` for ERROR — check silently fails.

```bash
# Build old lib + app
gcc -shared -fPIC -g old/lib.c -Iold -o liberr.so
gcc -g app.c -Iold -L. -lerr -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# → Error detected (correct)

# Swap in new lib (ERROR=99)
gcc -shared -fPIC -g new/lib.c -Inew -o liberr.so
./app
# → No error? Got 99 - WRONG! (v2 changed ERROR to 99)
```

**Why CRITICAL:** Error conditions are silently missed. Code that checks `if (r == ERROR)` 
never triggers with v2 — the error goes undetected. Any protocol, file format, or 
IPC using these integer values is broken across version boundaries.

## Why runtime result may differ from verdict
Enum value changed: integer value differs, silent wrong behavior
