# Case 63: Bitfield Width Changed

**Category:** Type Layout | **Verdict:** BREAKING

## What breaks

The `mode` bitfield in `RegMap` is widened from 3 bits to 5 bits. This shifts
every subsequent bitfield (`channel`, `priority`, `reserved`) to different bit
positions within the same 32-bit word. Any consumer compiled against the v1
layout reads `priority` from the wrong bits, getting a corrupt value.

## Why this matters

Bitfields are widely used in hardware register maps, network protocol headers,
and compact flag structs. Unlike regular struct fields where padding can absorb
small changes, **every bit position after the widened field shifts**. There is
no alignment padding between bitfields within the same storage unit.

This is especially dangerous because:
- `sizeof(RegMap)` does **not** change (still 4 bytes) — naive size checks pass
- The struct looks "compatible" at the symbol level — same functions, same names
- The corruption is **silent**: wrong values, no crash, no diagnostic

## Code diff

| Field | v1 (bits) | v2 (bits) | Change |
|-------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| `enable` | 0 | 0 | unchanged |
| `mode` | 1-3 (3 bits) | 1-5 (5 bits) | **widened +2 bits** |
| `channel` | 4-7 | 6-9 | **shifted +2** |
| `priority` | 8-15 | 10-17 | **shifted +2** |
| `reserved` | 16-31 (16 bits) | 18-31 (14 bits) | **shrunk -2 bits** |

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: CRITICAL**

**Scenario:** compile app against v1, swap in v2 `.so` without recompile.

```bash
# Build old library + app
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v1.c -o libfoo.so
gcc -g app.c -L. -lfoo -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# → priority = 128 (expected 128)

# Swap in new library (no recompile)
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v2.c -o libfoo.so
./app
# → priority = 32 (expected 128)
# → CORRUPTION: priority bits shifted due to bitfield width change!
```

**Why CRITICAL:** The v2 library writes `priority=128` into bits 10-17, but the
app (compiled against v1) reads bits 8-15 — extracting a completely different
value. No crash occurs; the data is silently wrong. In a hardware register
context, this could program the wrong DMA priority, causing system instability.

## How to fix

Never change bitfield widths in a public struct. If more bits are needed:

1. **Use the reserved field**: consume bits from `reserved` without shifting others
2. **Add a new struct version**: `RegMapV2` with the wider field
3. **Use an opaque handle**: hide the register layout behind accessor functions

## Real-world example

Linux kernel `iphdr` (IP header) structure uses bitfields for version and IHL.
Any change to these widths would corrupt every network packet parsed by
userspace tools like `tcpdump` that embed the struct layout at compile time.

The Windows `BITMAP` info header uses bitfields for color masks — driver
compatibility across Windows versions depends on these widths being frozen.

## abicheck detection

abicheck detects this as `field_bitfield_changed` (BREAKING) by comparing
DWARF `DW_AT_bit_size` / `DW_AT_bit_offset` attributes between the two
versions. Even though `sizeof` doesn't change, the per-field bit layout
difference is caught.
