# Case 117: [[no_unique_address]] layout overlay (no new ChangeKind)

**Category:** Binary ABI break / C++20 layout | **Verdict:** 🔴 BREAKING

## What changed

`v1` stores an empty stateless `EmptyPolicy` as an ordinary member of `Widget`,
so it occupies at least one byte and forces padding. `v2` marks the same member
`[[no_unique_address]]`, letting the compiler overlay it with the following
`value` member. `Widget` therefore shrinks and the offset of `value` moves.

## Why there is no dedicated ChangeKind

This is the point of the case: `[[no_unique_address]]` does not need a special
detector. The overlay manifests as a plain layout change that abicheck already
catches with its existing structural kinds:

- `type_size_changed` / `struct_size_changed` — `sizeof(Widget)` shrank
- `type_field_offset_changed` / `struct_field_offset_changed` — `value` moved
- possibly `type_alignment_changed` — depending on the members involved

A consumer compiled against the v1 layout reads `value` at the wrong offset
against v2. See `docs/development/adr/0001-deferred-modern-cpp-abi.md` for why
this (and not, say, C++20 modules) is in scope for the snapshot pipeline.

## Files
- `v1.h` / `v2.h` — ordinary vs `[[no_unique_address]]` member
- `v1.cpp` / `v2.cpp` — the two library builds
- `app.cpp` — consumer built against the v1 layout
