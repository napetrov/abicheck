# Case 40: Field Layout Changes

**Category:** Struct Field Layout | **Verdict:** BREAKING

## What changes

| Version | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| v1 | `struct Packet { int version; int sequence; int payload_size; unsigned flags:4; }` |
| v2 | `struct Packet { long version; /* sequence removed */ int payload_size; unsigned flags:8; int priority; }` |

## Why this is a binary ABI break

Every field-level change here corrupts the struct layout that old binaries were compiled
against:

1. **`version` type changed `int` to `long`** — on LP64, `int` is 4 bytes and `long` is
   8 bytes. The field is now twice as wide, pushing every subsequent field to a different
   offset.
2. **`sequence` removed** — old binaries still read/write at offset 4 expecting `sequence`,
   but v2 has `payload_size` there (or padding from the widened `version`).
3. **`payload_size` offset shifted** — was at offset 8 in v1, now at a different offset in
   v2 due to the type change and removal above.
4. **`flags` bitfield width 4 to 8** — changes how bits are packed within the storage unit.
   Old code masks to 4 bits; new code uses 8 bits.
5. **`priority` added** — appending a field to a struct is compatible only if no one relies
   on `sizeof(struct Packet)` for allocation or array indexing. But combined with the
   other changes, the struct is completely different.

## Code diff

```diff
 struct Packet {
-    int version;
+    long version;
-    int sequence;
+    /* sequence REMOVED */
     int payload_size;
-    unsigned flags : 4;
+    unsigned flags : 8;
+    int priority;
 };
```

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: CRITICAL**

**Scenario:** compile app against v1, swap in v2 `.so` without recompile.

```bash
# Build v1 lib + app
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v1.c -o libfoo.so
gcc -g app.c -I. -L. -lfoo -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# → sizeof(Packet) = 16
# → version      = 1
# → sequence     = 42
# → payload_size = 1024
# → flags        = 15
# → packet_send  = 1

# Swap to v2 (no recompile of app)
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v2.c -o libfoo.so
./app
# → packet_send returns wrong value!
# The app passes a v1-layout Packet (16 bytes) but the library
# reads it as a v2-layout Packet (24+ bytes). The library reads
# pkt->version as a long starting at offset 0, picking up both
# the old version and sequence fields as one 8-byte value.
# Result: corrupted data, wrong return value.
```

**Why CRITICAL:** Struct layout is baked into every compilation unit. When the library and
the application disagree on field offsets and sizes, every field access reads garbage.
There is no runtime error — just silently wrong data, which is the most dangerous class
of ABI break.

## Reproduce manually
```bash
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v1.c -o libv1.so
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v2.c -o libv2.so
abidw --out-file v1.xml libv1.so
abidw --out-file v2.xml libv2.so
abidiff v1.xml v2.xml
echo "exit: $?"   # → 12 (ABI change + breaking)
```

## How to fix
Never change field types, remove fields, or reorder fields in a public struct.
Use opaque pointers (`struct Packet *`) with accessor functions to allow internal layout
evolution. If layout must change, bump the SONAME.
