# Case 15 — `noexcept` Changed

**Category:** Risk | **Verdict:** 🟡 COMPATIBLE_WITH_RISK

> **ground_truth.json:** `expected: COMPATIBLE_WITH_RISK`, `category: risk`
> **checker_policy.py:** `FUNC_NOEXCEPT_REMOVED` ∈ `COMPATIBLE_KINDS`;
> `SYMBOL_VERSION_REQUIRED_ADDED` ∈ `RISK_KINDS`

## What changes

| Version | Signature | Implementation |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| v1 | `void reset() noexcept;` | no-throw implementation |
| v2 | `void reset();` | throws `std::runtime_error` |

## Why this is COMPATIBLE_WITH_RISK (not BREAKING)

The verdict has **two independent components**:

1. **`FUNC_NOEXCEPT_REMOVED` → COMPATIBLE**: In the Itanium C++ ABI (GCC/Clang),
   `noexcept` does **not** change the mangled symbol name. The symbol is identical
   in both `.so` files. Existing binaries resolve the same symbol — no linkage
   failure occurs. This is a source-level contract concern (C++17 function type
   system), not a binary ABI break.

2. **`SYMBOL_VERSION_REQUIRED_ADDED` → COMPATIBLE_WITH_RISK**: When v2's
   implementation uses `throw` (linking `__cxa_throw` / `std::runtime_error`),
   the compiled `.so` acquires a newer GLIBCXX symbol version requirement
   (e.g. `GLIBCXX_3.4.21`). This is a **deployment risk**: the new library
   won't load on systems with an older libstdc++. But it is not a binary ABI
   break for the library's own symbols.

**Combined verdict: COMPATIBLE_WITH_RISK** — binary-compatible, but deployment
risk present from the new GLIBCXX requirement.

## What abicheck detects

- **`FUNC_NOEXCEPT_REMOVED`** (COMPATIBLE) — detected in header mode (`-H`).
  The dumper reads the `noexcept` attribute from castxml output and stores it as
  `is_noexcept` on each function; the checker emits `FUNC_NOEXCEPT_REMOVED` when
  the flag changes between versions. This kind is classified as COMPATIBLE because
  it does not change the mangled symbol name (Itanium ABI).
- **`SYMBOL_VERSION_REQUIRED_ADDED: GLIBCXX_3.4.21`** (COMPATIBLE_WITH_RISK) —
  detected via ELF VERNEED comparison. When v2's implementation uses `throw`,
  the compiled `.so` acquires a newer GLIBCXX symbol version requirement.

Both kinds are detected. The combined verdict is **COMPATIBLE_WITH_RISK** because
`FUNC_NOEXCEPT_REMOVED` ∈ `COMPATIBLE_KINDS` and `SYMBOL_VERSION_REQUIRED_ADDED`
∈ `RISK_KINDS`, and RISK trumps COMPATIBLE in the verdict hierarchy.

## Behavioral risk (runtime)

While the binary linkage is fine, there is a **critical behavioral risk**:

Code compiled against v1 may omit exception landing pads, assuming `reset()` never
throws. If v2's `reset()` throws at runtime, the exception propagates through the
`noexcept` frame and `std::terminate` is called — no recovery possible.

This is a **contract violation**, not a linkage failure. The app terminates because
the caller trusted the `noexcept` guarantee, not because symbols are missing.

## Important distinction

This case demonstrates the difference between **ABI verdict** and **runtime safety**:

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Binary ABI (symbol linkage) | COMPATIBLE — same mangled name |
| Deployment risk (GLIBCXX) | COMPATIBLE_WITH_RISK — new version requirement |
| Runtime safety (behavioral) | CRITICAL — `std::terminate` if v2 throws |

The tool reports COMPATIBLE_WITH_RISK because it analyzes binary compatibility.
The behavioral risk (noexcept contract violation) is a separate concern that
requires source-level analysis or runtime testing to detect.

## Why abidiff misses it

`abidiff` compares DWARF type information and symbol tables. `noexcept` is **not
stored in DWARF** — it is purely a source-level annotation. abidiff has no way to
detect the change.

## Why ABICC catches it

ABICC parses C++ headers using GCC internals and sees the `noexcept` specifier.
When v1 and v2 headers differ in `noexcept`, ABICC flags it as a source-level break.

## Code diff

```diff
-void reset() noexcept;
+void reset();
```

## Reproduce steps

```bash
cd examples/case15_noexcept_change

# Build v1 and v2
g++ -shared -fPIC -std=c++17 -g v1.cpp -o libv1.so
g++ -shared -fPIC -std=c++17 -g v2.cpp -o libv2.so

# abidiff: misses the change (noexcept not in DWARF)
abidw --out-file v1.xml libv1.so
abidw --out-file v2.xml libv2.so
abidiff v1.xml v2.xml || true   # exits 0 — misses it!

# abicheck with headers: detects both noexcept removal and GLIBCXX bump
python3 -m abicheck.cli dump libv1.so -H v1.h -o /tmp/v1.json
python3 -m abicheck.cli dump libv2.so -H v2.h -o /tmp/v2.json
python3 -m abicheck.cli compare /tmp/v1.json /tmp/v2.json
# → COMPATIBLE_WITH_RISK
#   - func_noexcept_removed: Buffer::reset (COMPATIBLE)
#   - symbol_version_required_added: GLIBCXX_3.4.21 (RISK)
```

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: CRITICAL (behavioral, not linkage)**

**Scenario:** app compiled against v1 (`reset()` noexcept) calls v2 which throws —
exception propagates through a noexcept frame → `std::terminate`.

> **Important:** This demo combines two changes: (1) removing `noexcept` from the
> declaration, and (2) adding `throw` to the implementation.
>
> The `noexcept` removal itself is COMPATIBLE (same mangled symbol). The deployment
> risk comes from the GLIBCXX version requirement added by the `throw` in v2.
> The **runtime crash** is a behavioral contract violation — the caller omitted
> landing pads because v1 declared `noexcept`.

```bash
# Build v1 + app (app includes v1.h which declares reset() noexcept)
g++ -shared -fPIC -std=c++17 -g v1.cpp -o libbuf.so
g++ -std=c++17 -g app.cpp -I. -L. -lbuf -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# → Calling reset()...
# → reset() completed OK

# Swap in v2 (reset() throws)
g++ -shared -fPIC -std=c++17 -g v2.cpp -o libbuf.so
./app
# → terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
#      what():  reset failed
# → Aborted (core dumped)
```

**Why CRITICAL (behavioral):** The caller was compiled with the assumption that
`reset()` is `noexcept`, so no try/catch or landing pad was generated. When v2
throws, `std::terminate` is called unconditionally — no recovery possible.
Note: the binary linkage is fine (COMPATIBLE); the crash is a behavioral contract
violation, not a symbol resolution failure.

## Real-world example

In **Folly** (Facebook's C++ library), several internal `reset()` and `destroy()`
methods had `noexcept` removed during a refactor. Downstream projects compiled with
old headers started hitting silent `std::terminate` crashes when running with the
new `.so`.
