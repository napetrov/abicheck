# Case 65: Symbol Version Removed

**Category:** Symbol Versioning | **Verdict:** BREAKING

## What breaks

The `CRYPTO_1.0` symbol version node is removed from v2 of the library.
Old binaries that were linked against `crypto_hash@CRYPTO_1.0` record that
version requirement in their `.gnu.version_r` section. When the dynamic linker
tries to load v2 (which only provides `CRYPTO_2.0`), it cannot satisfy the
`CRYPTO_1.0` requirement and refuses to start the process.

## Why this matters

ELF symbol versioning (via `.gnu.version_d` / `.gnu.version_r` sections and
version scripts) is the primary mechanism for maintaining backward compatibility
in shared libraries across major-version boundaries. It allows a single `.so`
to provide multiple implementations of the same symbol for different ABI
generations.

Removing a version node is equivalent to removing symbols — but worse, because:
- The version was an **explicit promise** of backward compatibility
- Tools like `nm` or `readelf -s` still show `crypto_hash` in the symbol table,
  so the breakage is **invisible to naive checks**
- The failure happens at **load time**, not link time — binaries that appeared
  to link correctly fail only when deployed against the new library

## Code diff

```
v1.c:  .symver crypto_hash_v1,crypto_hash@CRYPTO_1.0   ← compat version
       .symver crypto_hash_v2,crypto_hash@@CRYPTO_2.0   ← default version
v1.map: CRYPTO_1.0 { crypto_hash; };
        CRYPTO_2.0 { crypto_hash; crypto_verify; } CRYPTO_1.0;

v2.c:  (no .symver — plain crypto_hash() definition)    ← CRYPTO_1.0 gone!
v2.map: CRYPTO_2.0 { crypto_hash; crypto_verify; };
```

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: CRITICAL**

**Scenario:** compile app against v1 (links to `crypto_hash@CRYPTO_1.0`),
swap in v2 `.so` which removed the `CRYPTO_1.0` version node.

```bash
# Build v1 library with both version nodes
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v1.c -Wl,--version-script=v1.map -o libcrypto.so
gcc -g app.c -L. -lcrypto -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# → hash("hello") = 99162322
# → OK: crypto_hash@CRYPTO_1.0 resolved successfully

# Check version requirement recorded in the binary
readelf -V app | grep CRYPTO
# → Name: CRYPTO_1.0  Flags: none  Version: 4

# Swap in v2 library (CRYPTO_1.0 removed)
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v2.c -Wl,--version-script=v2.map -o libcrypto.so
./app
# → ./app: ./libcrypto.so: version `CRYPTO_1.0' not found (required by ./app)
```

**Why CRITICAL:** The dynamic linker's version check is strict — if the required
version node doesn't exist in the loaded library, the process is killed
immediately. This is a hard failure with a clear error message, but it still
catches many library maintainers by surprise when they "clean up" old version
nodes.

## How to fix

Never remove a symbol version node from a shared library. Instead:

1. **Keep the old version node**: even if the implementation is identical, retain
   the `.symver` alias so old binaries still resolve
2. **Forward old versions**: `__asm__(".symver old_impl,func@OLD_VER")` can point
   the old version to the new implementation
3. **SONAME bump**: if you must drop old versions, increment the SONAME major
   version to force all consumers to re-link

## Real-world example

glibc maintains symbol versions going back to `GLIBC_2.0` (1997). Removing any
version node would break every binary linked against that version — potentially
millions of executables across the entire Linux ecosystem. This is why glibc's
version script is append-only.

OpenSSL 3.0 removed the `OPENSSL_1.0.0` and `OPENSSL_1.1.0` version nodes,
which is why it required a SONAME change from `libssl.so.1.1` to `libssl.so.3`
— all consumers had to be rebuilt.

## abicheck detection

abicheck detects this as `symbol_version_defined_removed` (BREAKING) by
comparing the `.gnu.version_d` sections of the two library versions.
