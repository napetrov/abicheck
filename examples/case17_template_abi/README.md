# Case 17 — Template Instantiation ABI Change

**Verdict:** 🔴 BREAKING

> **Note:** The verdict was previously marked COMPATIBLE in error.
> When app_v1 is loaded against libv2.so using LD_PRELOAD, the v2 constructor
> writes 24 bytes into a 16-byte stack slot → sentinel corruption confirmed at runtime.
> abicheck correctly detects `struct_size_changed: Buffer<int> 16→24` = BREAKING.
## What changes

| Version | `Buffer<int>` layout |
|---------|---------------------|
| v1 | `{ T* data_; size_t size_; }` → sizeof = 16 bytes (64-bit) |
| v2 | `{ T* data_; size_t size_; size_t capacity_; }` → sizeof = 24 bytes |

## What breaks at binary level

C++ template classes with explicit instantiations are compiled into the `.so` like
regular classes. The mangled symbol for `Buffer<int>::Buffer(size_t)` is
`_ZN6BufferIiEC1Em` — identical in both versions.

A caller compiled against v1 headers **allocates** `sizeof(Buffer<int>) = 16` bytes
(e.g. on the stack or in a struct). The v2 `.so` constructor writes **24 bytes** —
overwriting 8 bytes past the allocated region. This is a classic **stack smash / heap
corruption** scenario, extremely hard to debug.

## Why abidiff catches it (with DWARF)

When compiled with `-g`, DWARF records the type layout for `Buffer<int>`. `abidiff`
compares type offsets and sizes → detects `sizeof` grew from 16 to 24. Without `-g`,
abidiff sees only the symbol table and misses the layout change.

## Why ABICC catches it

ABICC parses the header AST and computes `sizeof` for all template instantiations
referenced in the headers. It sees `capacity_` was added and reports:
> "Size of type 'Buffer<int>' changed from 16 to 24 bytes."

## Real-world example

In large numeric libraries, templated classes like `HomogenNumericTable<float>` are
often explicitly instantiated in the `.so`. When a private member is added for
thread-safety tracking, downstream bindings compiled with old headers write past
buffers. This class of bug is typically caught by ASAN in integration tests.

## Code diff

```diff
 template<typename T>
 class Buffer {
 private:
     T*          data_;
     std::size_t size_;
+    std::size_t capacity_;  // NEW field
 };
```

## Reproduce steps

```bash
cd examples/case17_template_abi

# Build with debug info
g++ -shared -fPIC -std=c++17 -g v1.cpp -o libv1.so
g++ -shared -fPIC -std=c++17 -g v2.cpp -o libv2.so

# abidiff WITH DWARF catches layout change
abidw --out-file v1.xml libv1.so
abidw --out-file v2.xml libv2.so
abidiff v1.xml v2.xml   # exit 4: reports Buffer<int> size change

# Build WITHOUT debug info (strip DWARF)
g++ -shared -fPIC -std=c++17 v1.cpp -o libv1_nodebug.so
g++ -shared -fPIC -std=c++17 v2.cpp -o libv2_nodebug.so
abidw --out-file v1nd.xml libv1_nodebug.so
abidw --out-file v2nd.xml libv2_nodebug.so
abidiff v1nd.xml v2nd.xml   # exit 0: MISSES the change (no DWARF)

# ABICC catches via header AST regardless of debug info
abi-compliance-checker -lib Buffer -v1 1.0 -v2 2.0 \
  -header v1.hpp -header v2.hpp \
  -gcc-options "-std=c++17"
```

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: CRITICAL**

**Scenario:** app compiled with v1 layout (Buffer<int> = 16 bytes) runs against v2 constructor that writes 24 bytes → stack overflow.

```bash
# Build v1 + app
g++ -shared -fPIC -std=c++17 -g v1.cpp -o libbuf.so
g++ -std=c++17 -g -O0 app.cpp -I. -L. -lbuf -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# → sizeof(Buffer<int>) at compile time = 16
# → before ctor: sentinel = SENTINEL
# → after  ctor: sentinel = SENTINEL   (v1: only 16 bytes written)

# Swap in v2 (constructor writes 24 bytes — 8 bytes past the 16-byte slot)
g++ -shared -fPIC -std=c++17 -g v2.cpp -o libbuf.so
./app
# → sizeof(Buffer<int>) at compile time = 16
# → before ctor: sentinel = SENTINEL
# → after  ctor: sentinel =           ← CORRUPTED (v2 wrote 8 bytes past slot)
# → CORRUPTION: v2 constructor wrote past Buffer slot!

# With ASAN:
g++ -shared -fPIC -std=c++17 -g -fsanitize=address v2.cpp -o libbuf.so
g++ -std=c++17 -g -fsanitize=address app.cpp -I. -L. -lbuf -Wl,-rpath,. -o app_asan
./app_asan
# → ERROR: AddressSanitizer: stack-buffer-overflow
```

**Why CRITICAL:** The v2 constructor writes a new `capacity_` field at offset 16,
but the app only reserved 16 bytes on the stack. The 8 bytes past the allocation are
overwritten — classic stack smash, potentially corrupting return addresses.

## Why runtime result may differ from verdict
Template instantiation in binary: symbol names unchanged
