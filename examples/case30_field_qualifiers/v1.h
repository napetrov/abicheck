/* case30: Field qualifier changes (const, volatile)
 *
 * Demonstrates two field qualifier scenarios on C struct fields:
 * - A field gains const (callers can no longer write to it directly)
 * - A field gains volatile (compiler must re-read from memory on every access)
 *
 * Note: `mutable` is a C++ keyword only — it has no meaning in C structs.
 * This is a pure C example; all three fields are plain `int` in v1.
 *
 * Binary layout: UNCHANGED — qualifiers are semantic/source-level only.
 * abicheck detects: FIELD_BECAME_CONST, FIELD_BECAME_VOLATILE
