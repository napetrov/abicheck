# Case 30 — Field Qualifier Changes (const, volatile)

**Category:** Type Qualifiers | **Verdict:** 🔴 BREAKING (policy escalated source break)


## Compatibility classification

- **Binary ABI impact:** Usually layout-compatible (no size/offset change), but stale optimization assumptions can still break behavior.
- **Source compatibility impact:** BREAKING (`const` write errors, `volatile` contract changes).
- **Runtime behavior impact:** Semantic divergence (stale reads / UB writes) without linker errors.
- **Policy severity:** **BREAKING** in `ground_truth.json` (`source_break` category escalated by policy).

## What changes

| Field | v1 | v2 | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sample_rate` | `int sample_rate` | `const int sample_rate` | Writing becomes UB |
| `raw_value` | `int raw_value` | `volatile int raw_value` | Compiler must not cache reads |
| `cache_hits` | `int cache_hits` | `int cache_hits` | Unchanged |

## Why this IS a (semantic) ABI break

The binary layout of `struct SensorConfig` is **unchanged** — `const` and `volatile`
do not affect size, alignment, or field offsets. An existing binary will link and
run against the v2 library without error.

However, the **API contract** has changed:

1. **`const int sample_rate`:** Code compiled against v1 freely writes to `sample_rate`.
   The v2 header declares this field `const`, meaning the library now considers it
   immutable after initialization. Writing to a `const`-qualified field through a
   non-`const` pointer is undefined behavior in C. Compilers recompiling against v2
   will reject the write at compile time.

2. **`volatile int raw_value`:** Code compiled against v1 may have the compiler optimize
   away redundant reads of `raw_value`. The v2 header marks it `volatile`, indicating
   it may change asynchronously (e.g., hardware-mapped). Binaries compiled without
   `volatile` may return stale cached values.

## Code diff

```diff
 struct SensorConfig {
-    int   sample_rate;
-    int   raw_value;
+    const int    sample_rate;
+    volatile int raw_value;
     int   cache_hits;
 };
```

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: MODERATE (semantic break, not crash)**

**Scenario:** Compile app against v1 headers, swap in v2 `.so`.

```bash
# Build v1 library + app
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v1.c -o libfoo.so
gcc -g app.c -I. -L. -lfoo -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# → Field qualifier change demo (compiled against v1.h):
# →
# → Initial state:
# →   sample_rate = 1000
# →   raw_value   = 42
# →   cache_hits  = 0
# →
# → sensor_read(&cfg) = 42
# →
# → After setting sample_rate = 2000:
# →   sample_rate = 2000
# →
# → raw_value read twice: r1=99 r2=99 (should be equal)
# → ...
# → sensor_read(&cfg) after modifications = 99

# Swap in v2 (no recompile)
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v2.c -o libfoo.so
./app
# → Output is identical — binary layout unchanged.
# → But the semantic contract is now violated: the app writes
# → to sample_rate which v2 declares const.
```

**Source break verification** (recompilation against v2 will warn/error):

```bash
# Create a temporary source that includes v2.h instead of v1.h
sed 's/#include "v1.h"/#include "v2.h"/' app.c > /tmp/app_v2_test.c
gcc -g /tmp/app_v2_test.c -I. -L. -lfoo -Wl,-rpath,. -o app_v2 2>&1
# → error: assignment of read-only member 'sample_rate'
#   (because sample_rate is const in v2.h)
rm -f /tmp/app_v2_test.c
```

## Reproduce with abicheck

```bash
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v1.c -o libfoo_v1.so
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v2.c -o libfoo_v2.so
abidw --out-file v1.xml libfoo_v1.so
abidw --out-file v2.xml libfoo_v2.so
abidiff v1.xml v2.xml
echo "exit: $?"
```

## How to fix

- Do not add `const` to fields of public structs unless the field was always
  documented as read-only.
- If a field must become immutable, provide setter/getter functions instead of
  direct field access, and hide the struct behind an opaque pointer.
- Adding `volatile` should be done only in a new struct or with a major version bump.
