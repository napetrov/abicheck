# Case 56: Struct Packing Changed (pragma pack)

**Category:** Type Layout / DWARF | **Verdict:** BREAKING

## What this case is about

v1 defines `Record` with natural alignment (sizeof = 12, value at offset 4).
v2 adds `#pragma pack(1)`, eliminating all padding (sizeof = 6, value at offset 1).

This is a **silent ABI break** because every field (except `tag`) moves to a
different offset, and the struct size shrinks.

## What breaks at binary level

- **sizeof changes**: 12 → 6. Stack allocations and arrays use wrong size.
- **Field offsets change**: `value` moves from offset 4 to offset 1.
- **Alignment changes**: `value` is no longer naturally aligned (may cause
  unaligned access faults on strict architectures like ARM).

## What abicheck detects

- **`STRUCT_PACKING_CHANGED`**: Detected via DWARF `DW_AT_byte_size` and field
  `DW_AT_data_member_location` changes. The packing attribute itself is recorded
  in DWARF as alignment metadata.

**Overall verdict: BREAKING**

## How to reproduce

```bash
gcc -shared -fPIC -g bad.c  -include bad.h  -o libbad.so
gcc -shared -fPIC -g good.c -include good.h -o libgood.so

# Verify layout difference
pahole libbad.so  -C Record  # → size 12, value at offset 4
pahole libgood.so -C Record  # → size 6,  value at offset 1

python3 -m abicheck.cli dump libbad.so  -o /tmp/v1.json
python3 -m abicheck.cli dump libgood.so -o /tmp/v2.json
python3 -m abicheck.cli compare /tmp/v1.json /tmp/v2.json
# → BREAKING: field offsets changed
```

## Real-world examples

- Windows API headers use `#pragma pack` extensively. Mixing packed and unpacked
  struct definitions across DLL boundaries is a common source of crashes.
- Network protocol libraries (e.g., pcap headers) often accidentally change
  packing when refactoring header includes.
