# Case 21 — Method Became Static

**Verdict:** 🔴 BREAKING (calling convention contract)

## What changes

| Version | Declaration |
|---------|-------------|
| v1 | `class Widget { int value; int bar(); };` |
| v2 | `class Widget { static int bar(); };` |

## Why this is ABI-breaking

For Itanium C++ ABI, static-ness is not encoded in symbol mangling for this case,
so the symbol still resolves (`_ZN6Widget3barEv`).

But call contract changes:
- v1 call site passes implicit `this`
- v2 static function expects no `this`

So old binaries can still link, yet execute with a mismatched calling convention.

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: CRITICAL**

This demo shows a deterministic wrong result (not only “possible UB”):
- v1 behavior: returns `value + 1`
- app sets `value=41`, expects `42`
- v2 static method returns fixed `7`

```bash
# Build v1 + app (compiled against old header)
g++ -shared -fPIC -g old/lib.cpp -Iold -o libwidget.so
g++ -g app.cpp -Iold -L. -lwidget -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# expected:
# bar() called (instance method), value=41
# got=42 expected=42

# Swap in v2 (method became static, same symbol still links)
g++ -shared -fPIC -g new/lib.cpp -Inew -o libwidget.so
./app
# expected:
# bar() called (static method), returning fixed value
# got=7 expected=42
# WRONG RESULT: method call contract changed (instance -> static)
```

## Why this case matters

This is a silent binary-compat trap: loader/linker are happy, but runtime semantics are broken.
No crash is required to prove ABI break — wrong results are enough.
