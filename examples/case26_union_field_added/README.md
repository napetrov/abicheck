# Case 26 — Union Field Added


**Verdict:** 🔴 BREAKING
**abicheck verdict: BREAKING** (TYPE_SIZE_CHANGED: union grows 4→8 bytes)

## What changes

| Version | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| v1 | `union Value { int i; float f; };` |
| v2 | `union Value { int i; float f; double d; };` |

## Why this IS a binary ABI break

Adding `double d` makes `double` the largest member, so `sizeof(union Value)` grows
from **4 bytes** (max of `int`=4, `float`=4) to **8 bytes** (`double`=8).

This is a **TYPE_SIZE_CHANGED** break because:
- Old callers allocate 4 bytes for `union Value` on the stack or in a struct.
- The v2 library's `fill()` may write 8 bytes, overwriting adjacent memory.
- Array indexing breaks: `Value arr[10]` → old caller: 40 bytes, library expects 80 bytes.

All union fields still share offset 0, so the field layout is unchanged — but the
size change makes this **BREAKING**, not just informational.

## What it does affect

- **Union size**: `sizeof(union Value)` grows 4→8 bytes → TYPE_SIZE_CHANGED → BREAKING.
- **Struct embedding**: any struct containing `union Value` also grows, shifting later fields.
- **Array indexing**: `Value arr[N]` stride changes from 4 to 8 bytes.

## Contrast with other union changes

| Change | Verdict | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Field **added** (no size change) | COMPATIBLE | Existing fields at offset 0 unchanged, sizeof same |
| Field **added** (size grows) | BREAKING | TYPE_SIZE_CHANGED — callers under-allocate |
| Field **removed** | BREAKING | Removes a valid representation |
| Field **type changed** | BREAKING | Reinterpretation of shared storage |

## Code diff

```diff
 union Value {
     int i;
     float f;
+    double d;   /* sizeof grows 4 → 8 bytes: BREAKING */
 };
```

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: BREAKING** (TYPE_SIZE_CHANGED)

**Scenario:** app reads `v.i` after `fill()`. Adding a `double d` field doesn't affect `int i`
access — but the union is now 8 bytes. Any caller that stack-allocated 4 bytes and passes
`&v` to a v2 function that writes 8 bytes has a stack overflow.

```bash
# Build old lib + app
gcc -shared -fPIC -g old/lib.c -Iold -o libval.so
gcc -g app.c -Iold -L. -lval -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# → v.i = 42 (expected 42)

# Swap in new lib (double field added — sizeof grows 4→8 bytes)
gcc -shared -fPIC -g new/lib.c -Inew -o libval.so
./app
# → v.i = 42 (expected 42)  ← may still appear correct for int-only access
# But: abicheck reports TYPE_SIZE_CHANGED (4→8) → BREAKING
```

**Why BREAKING:** `sizeof(union Value)` grows from 4 to 8 bytes due to `double d`.
Old callers that allocate `union Value` on the stack or embed it in a struct
under-allocate memory when running against the v2 library. abicheck correctly
reports TYPE_SIZE_CHANGED → BREAKING verdict.

## Why runtime result may differ from verdict
Union field added (double): sizeof(Value) grows 4→8 bytes, layout broken

## Runtime note
v2 now writes the newly added double field so old-layout callers observe incompatible behavior.
