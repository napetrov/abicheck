# Case 23 — Virtual Method Became Pure Virtual


**Verdict:** 🔴 BREAKING
**abicheck verdict: BREAKING**

## What changes

| Version | Declaration |
|---------|-----------|
| v1 | `class Processor { virtual void process(); };` |
| v2 | `class Processor { virtual void process() = 0; };` |

## What breaks at binary level

Making `Processor::process()` pure virtual (`= 0`) has two ABI consequences:

1. **The vtable entry for `process()` is replaced** — the slot that previously
   pointed to `Processor`'s concrete implementation of `process()` now points to
   the pure-call handler (`__cxa_pure_virtual`). Already-compiled consumers that
   invoke `process()` through a `Processor*` vtable dispatch will hit the pure-call
   handler at runtime, causing `std::terminate` instead of calling the old base
   implementation.

2. **`Processor` becomes abstract** — source-level rebuilds will fail to compile
   `new Processor()` (abstract class cannot be instantiated). For already-compiled
   binaries this is not the direct failure mode; the runtime break comes from point 1
   above (dispatch to the pure-call handler via the vtable slot).

## Consumer impact

```cpp
/* consumer compiled against v1 (concrete class) */
Processor* p = new Processor();
p->process();  /* calls concrete implementation */

/* with v2: Processor is abstract */
/* vtable slot points to __cxa_pure_virtual */
/* → runtime abort: "pure virtual method called" */
```

For plugin architectures where downstream code `extends` the interface:

```cpp
/* old plugin implements only process() */
struct MyPlugin : Processor {
    void process() override;
};
/* this still works — but any new pure virtual methods
   added to Processor would break existing plugins */
```

## Mitigation

- Create `Processor2` (or `IProcessor`) as the new abstract interface.
- Keep the original `Processor` class frozen for existing consumers.
- Version plugin interfaces explicitly.

## Code diff

```diff
 class Processor {
 public:
-    virtual void process();
+    virtual void process() = 0;
 };
```

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: CRITICAL**

**Scenario:** app calls `process()` via vtable. With v2 the vtable slot points to `__cxa_pure_virtual` → `abort()`.

```bash
# Build old lib + app
g++ -shared -fPIC -g old/lib.cpp -Iold -o libproc.so
g++ -g app.cpp -Iold -L. -lproc -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# → Calling process()...
# → processing
# → Done.

# Swap in new lib (pure virtual → abort)
g++ -shared -fPIC -g new/lib.cpp -Inew -o libproc.so
./app
# → Calling process()...
# → pure virtual method called
# → Aborted (core dumped)
```

**Why CRITICAL:** Existing binaries that instantiate `Processor` and call `process()`
via the vtable now hit the pure-virtual handler, causing unconditional `abort()`.
Every plugin or subclass compiled against v1 must be rebuilt with the new abstract interface.

## Why runtime result may differ from verdict
Became pure virtual: direct instantiation causes SIGABRT
