# Case 48: Leaf Struct Change Propagated Through Pointer

**Category:** Breaking | **Verdict:** 🔴 BREAKING

## What breaks

A nested "leaf" struct `Leaf` gains a new `int z` field, growing from **4 → 8 bytes**.
`Leaf` is embedded (not pointed to) inside `Container`, so `Container::flags` shifts
from offset 8 to offset 16. The public API only takes `Container*` — no by-value
`Leaf` in function signatures — but the size change propagates through the embedding.

Callers compiled against v1 allocate `Container` with the old layout: passing such
a struct to a v2 function causes `flags` to be read at the wrong offset.

## Why abidiff catches it

abidiff reports `Leaf_Type_Change` / `TYPE_SIZE_CHANGED` and exits **4**.
abicheck detects: `TYPE_SIZE_CHANGED` on `Leaf` (4→8 bytes) propagates to `Container`.

## Code diff

| v1.h | v2.h |
|------|------|
| `typedef struct Leaf { short x; short y; } Leaf;` — 4 bytes | `typedef struct Leaf { short x; short y; int z; } Leaf;` — 8 bytes |
| `Container { int id; Leaf position; int flags; }` — `flags` at offset 8 | `Container { int id; Leaf position; int flags; }` — `flags` at offset 16 |

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL — silent wrong-field reads**

```bash
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v1.c -o libv1.so
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v2.c -o libv2.so

abidw --out-file v1.abi libv1.so
abidw --out-file v2.abi libv2.so
abidiff v1.abi v2.abi
echo "exit: $?"   # → 4 (TYPE_SIZE_CHANGED on Leaf → Container)
```

## Reproduce manually

```bash
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v1.c -o libv1.so
gcc -shared -fPIC -g v2.c -o libv2.so
abidw --headers-dir . --out-file v1.abi libv1.so
abidw --headers-dir . --out-file v2.abi libv2.so
abidiff v1.abi v2.abi
```

## How to fix

1. **Pimpl on Leaf** — replace embedded `Leaf` with `Leaf*` (pointer to incomplete type); size is pointer-stable.
2. **Add field without breaking**: only possible if there is tail padding in the struct — verify with `pahole`.
3. **SONAME bump** if embedding is required and the field is necessary.

## Real-world pattern

TBB's `tbb::task_arena` was embedded in some library public headers. When TBB changed
`task_arena`'s internal layout, all consumers of those libraries were broken — same
propagation mechanism as this case. See `case18_dependency_leak` for the external-library variant.
