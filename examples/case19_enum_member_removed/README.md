# Case 19 — Enum Member Removed

**abicheck verdict: BREAKING**

## What changes

| Version | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| v1 | `enum Status { OK = 0, ERROR = 1, FOO = 2 };` |
| v2 | `enum Status { OK = 0, ERROR = 1 };` |

## What breaks at binary level

Removing an enum member invalidates any code that uses that member's numeric value.
Existing binaries that were compiled with `FOO = 2` may store, transmit, or switch on
that value. The new library no longer defines that value as a valid member of the enum.

This is a **semantic ABI break**: while the remaining values (`OK`, `ERROR`) are still
at the same numeric positions, the removed value `FOO = 2` becomes undefined in the
new version. Persisted data, protocol messages, or configuration files that contain
the removed value will be misinterpreted.

## Consumer impact

```c
/* consumer compiled against v1 */
enum Status s = FOO;  /* s = 2 */
write_to_file(s);

/* later, same consumer reads back value 2 with v2 library */
/* library has no FOO — value 2 is undefined behavior */
```

## Mitigation

- Never remove released enum members; mark them as deprecated instead.
- Map legacy values deliberately in deserialization/protocol handling.
- Use explicit sentinel values (e.g., `STATUS_MAX`) to define valid ranges.

## Code diff

```diff
-enum Status { OK = 0, ERROR = 1, FOO = 2 };
+enum Status { OK = 0, ERROR = 1 };
```

## Real Failure Demo

**Severity: CRITICAL**

**Scenario:** app compiled with old header (has `FOO=2`) calls library that returns value 2. With v2, `FOO` is removed — the value 2 is undefined.

```bash
# Build old lib + app
gcc -shared -fPIC -g old/lib.c -Iold -o libstatus.so
gcc -g app.c -Iold -L. -lstatus -Wl,-rpath,. -o app
./app
# → FOO

# Swap in new lib (FOO removed, but still returns integer 2)
gcc -shared -fPIC -g new/lib.c -Inew -o libstatus.so
./app
# → FOO    ← prints "FOO" because value 2 still matches the compiled switch case
#            but in new headers this value is UNDEFINED — semantic break
# Any consumer recompiled against new headers would get no FOO case → "UNKNOWN: 2"
```

**Why CRITICAL:** Old binaries still "work" but carry a time bomb — any serialized,
stored, or transmitted value of `FOO` (integer 2) is now undefined in the new API.
Recompiled consumers get no `FOO` case and fall through to `default`, silently
mishandling the value.
