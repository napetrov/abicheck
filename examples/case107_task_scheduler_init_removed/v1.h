// case107 v1 — mirrors classic TBB's `task_scheduler_init`.
//
// In TBB <= 2020, applications initialized the runtime by constructing a
// `tbb::task_scheduler_init` object. The class was deprecated in 2020 and
// fully removed in oneTBB 2021.1. Removal of this whole class (including
// its public ctors/dtors and `terminate()`/`initialize()` members) is the
// single biggest hard ABI break in TBB's history.
//
// This case captures the canonical "previously-exported class with virtual
// methods disappears" shape so we have a named regression fixture.
