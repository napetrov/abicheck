# abicheck field-evaluation — cumulative findings log

Format: each problem has an ID, category (DISCOVERY / USABILITY / PERF / CORRECTNESS),
severity, what happened, repro, and a suggested fix. Timings tracked in `timing.jsonl`
and the per-iteration tables below. Environment: 4c/15GB Linux, abicheck 0.3.0,
gcc 13.3 / clang 18.1, castxml ABSENT.

---

## Iteration 1 — conda-forge dozen (C libs, CMake source phase)

### Problems found

- **P01 [DISCOVERY/high]** Runtime `.so` lives in a *split* conda package, not the
  named one. `zlib`→`libzlib`, `webp`→`libwebp-base`, C lib of zstd/lz4 is `zstd`/`lz4-c`.
  A user pointing abicheck at "the zlib package" finds only a `.so` symlink + headers, no
  runtime object. abicheck has no help here — it's purely the user's problem to locate the
  artifact. *Fix idea:* a `fetch`/discovery helper, or docs on conda split-package layout.

- **P02 [DISCOVERY/med]** conda variant selection: `libxml2` 2.15.0 build I picked shipped
  only `bin/`, no `lib/`. Highest-build-number heuristic can land on a variant without the lib.

- **P03 [USABILITY/high]** `dump --show-data-sources` is **preview-only** — it prints the
  L0–L5 table but does NOT collect/embed. Ran it expecting L3/L4/L5 to be embedded; got a
  no-op (0.3s) and an empty snapshot. Wording ("not collected in --show-data-sources") is
  easy to miss. *Fix idea:* make the flag additive (collect AND show), or louder warning.

- **P04 [USABILITY/high]** Passing `-H <header>` to scope the public surface triggers the
  **L2 castxml path** and hard-errors `castxml not found in PATH` — even though the goal was
  only to designate public headers for L4. The C-front-end requirement leaks into a flag a
  user reaches for naturally. *Fix idea:* `-H` should degrade to header-as-public-marker
  without castxml; only the AST-extraction features should hard-require it.

- **P05 [USABILITY/med]** L4 source replay parsed every TU (paying full clang cost) but
  returned `reachable_declarations/types/matched_symbols = 0` for C libs. The default `clang`
  extractor emits inline/template/constexpr *body fingerprints*; a pure-C public API has none,
  so the spend yields ~nothing. No warning that "this extractor will find little for C".
  *Fix idea:* detect C-only surface and warn, or auto-select castxml decl extractor.

- **P06 [PERF/med]** L4 replay is serial per-TU clang: zstd 92 TUs → 73.8s (0.8s/TU).
  Obvious parallelization target (4 idle cores during the run).

- **P07 [DISCOVERY/med]** Plain `compile_commands.json` yields compile_units but
  `targets/toolchains = 0`. Toolchain/compiler identity needs CMake File API or the binary's
  `.GCC.command.line`/`DW_AT_producer`. So "which compiler built this" is invisible from the
  compile DB alone.

### Timings (iteration 1)
- dump (elf_only): 0.3–0.6s; dump (dwarf_aware, libuv 2.1MB snap): 3.9s; compare: 0.3–0.5s
- L3 build data: 0.3–0.5s flat | L4+L5: 9.8s (zlib/34TU) · 73.8s (zstd/92TU) · 9.0s (snappy/4TU C++)
- abicheck self-runs cmake via `.abicheck.yml build.query` + `--allow-build-query`: +0.95s

---

## Iteration 2 — larger products + build-system discovery (meson vs autotools)

### Binary scan (8 larger products, 156s total)

| lib | old→new | so picked | funcs | verdict | total chg | compare_s | snap |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| icu | 75.1→78.3 | libicui18n | 8k | BREAKING | 16022 | **94.5s** | 18.6MB |
| hdf5 | 1.8.20→2.1.0 | libhdf5 | 3.4k | BREAKING | 1968 | 1.5s | 4.6MB |
| protobuf | 6.34→7.35 | libprotobuf | 3.2k | BREAKING | 400 | 1.5s | 8.2MB |
| glib | 2.86→2.88 | libgio | 2.2k | COMPATIBLE | 11 | 0.8s | 4.5MB |
| openssl | 3.6.1→4.0.1 | libcrypto | 5.9k | BREAKING | 5941 | 1.9s | 11MB |
| gmp | 6.2.1→6.3.0 | libgmp | 876 | BREAKING | 7 | 0.5s | 1.7MB |
| flac | 1.4.3→1.5.0 | libFLAC++ | 417 | BREAKING | 19 | 0.4s | 1MB |
| openblas | 0.3.8→0.3.9 | libopenblas | 12.2k | COMPATIBLE(dwarf) | 1 | 3.4s | 23MB |

### Problems found

- **P08 [CORRECTNESS/USABILITY/high]** Symbol-naming conventions create huge noise.
  **ICU** embeds the major version in every symbol (`u_foo_75`→`u_foo_78`) → 5395 removed +
  5493 added + **2539 `func_likely_renamed`** = 16022 changes for a routine ICU upgrade. The
  report is unusable without knowing ICU's convention. **OpenSSL** symbol versioning →
  **5640 `symbol_moved_version_node`**. *Fix idea:* convention-aware renamers / a "versioned
  symbol scheme" suppression preset for ICU/OpenSSL-style libs.

- **P09 [DISCOVERY/high]** **Silent empty result on autotools trees.** `configure` emits NO
  `compile_commands.json` (autotools never does). `abicheck dump --sources <autotools-tree>`
  returns `build_source: False`, 0 compile_units, **and 0 diagnostics** — no hint that a compile
  DB was looked for and not found, nor a suggestion to use `bear`. A user gets nothing and no
  explanation. *Fix idea:* emit a diagnostic "no compile_commands.json found under <tree>
  (looked in: . build out _build cmake-build-debug); for autotools/make run `bear -- make`".

- **P10 [DISCOVERY/med]** Autotools-from-git bootstrap is fragile: `libffi` `./autogen.sh`
  failed `LT_SYS_SYMBOL_USCORE undefined` even with libtool+libtool-bin installed. Realistic
  flow is the release tarball (ships `configure`). Not abicheck's bug but it's the discovery
  reality for autotools L3.

- **P11 [PERF/high]** `compare` scales poorly with surface size + change count: ICU (8k
  defined-export funcs, 16k changes) = **94.5s** just for compare (regenerated `results2.json`);
  dump of a 20MB `.so` = 6s; openblas DWARF snapshot = 23MB / 9.5s dump. Large libs make the diff
  the bottleneck, not parsing.

- **P12 [DISCOVERY/low]** Compile-DB auto-discovery hint dirs are `("", build, out, _build,
  cmake-build-debug)`. Meson's common `builddir` name is NOT covered (only `build`/`_build`).
  A meson user who runs `meson setup builddir` won't be auto-discovered.

### Build-system matrix (source-phase discovery)

| build system | compile DB native? | when produced | abicheck auto-discover | L3 time |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CMake** | yes (`-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON`) | configure | needs `build/` name | 0.3–0.5s |
| **Meson** | **yes, always** | `meson setup` (no build) | ✅ `build/` auto-found | 0.32s |
| **Autotools** | **no** | never | ❌ silent empty (P09) | — |
| Autotools + `bear` | via intercept | needs **full `make`** | ✅ DB at tree root | 0.30s |

- Meson is the smoothest: native compile DB at *configure* time, abicheck picks it up with zero flags.
- Autotools is the worst: no DB ever; `bear -- make` works but forces a full build (libffi 9.75s;
  scales with project size), and abicheck gives no guidance when the DB is absent.

### Timings (iteration 2)
- meson setup (freetype, 42 TU): 0.85s | autotools configure (libffi): 6.5s | bear -- make (libffi, 20 TU): 9.75s
- L3 (meson auto-discover): 0.32s | L3+L4+L5 (freetype 42 TU): 31.9s (~0.76s/TU)
- compare on huge surfaces: icu 94.5s, openssl 2.5s, openblas 3.4s (regenerated `results2.json`)

## Iteration 3 — LLVM scale stress test

`libllvm17` 17.0.6 (libLLVM-17.so, 150MB) vs `libllvm18` 18.1.8 (libLLVM.so.18.1, 154MB).
Defined-export FUNCs **~31k** (libLLVM.so.18 = 30,913 measured). [Earlier raw readelf figures
146,339 / 153,115 were inflated by `.symtab` + `UND` imports — see Correction.]

| step | time | peak RSS | output |
|---|---|---|---|
| dump v17 | 17.0s | 329MB | 39MB snapshot |
| dump v18 | 15.7s | 337MB | 40MB snapshot |
| compare | 22.0s | 301MB | 50,443 changes, **BREAKING** |

Result: 2,338 breaking, 44,771 risk, 3,334 additions. Top kinds:
`symbol_moved_version_node`×**36,991**, `vtable_symbol_identity_changed`×7,763,
`func_added`×2,580, `func_removed_elf_only`×1,808.

### Findings
- **POSITIVE** abicheck handles LLVM-scale (150MB, ~31k defined exports) in **~55s end-to-end**
  with **~330MB RAM** — memory-efficient, no blowup. The L0 path scales fine to the biggest
  real-world C++ shared library.
- **P11 refined [PERF]** Compare cost is driven by the **fuzzy rename matcher**, NOT raw symbol
  count: LLVM (~31k exports, 93 renames) = 22s, but ICU (8k exports, **2134** renames) = 94.5s —
  *fewer* exports yet 4× slower, because rename detection dominates. The
  rename heuristic is ~O(removed×added); naming schemes that maximize add+remove churn (ICU's
  `_NN` version suffix) are the worst case. *Fix idea:* cap/bucket rename candidates, or skip
  rename detection above a churn threshold.
- **P08 reinforced** LLVM repeats the OpenSSL pattern: a versioned-symbol scheme (`LLVM_17`→
  `LLVM_18`) yields **36,991 `symbol_moved_version_node`** risk findings on a routine major
  upgrade — overwhelmingly convention noise. A "lib-versioned symbol nodes" normalization/preset
  would cut 70%+ of the LLVM report.
- **P13 [PERF/scope]** L4 source replay is **infeasible for LLVM-sized projects**: clone
  (~GB) + cmake configure (minutes) + clang replay of thousands of TUs @ ~0.8s/TU = hours. The
  source/build layer is realistically scoped to small/medium libraries or changed-TU subsets,
  not monorepos. (Not tested live — bounded out as impractical for a loop turn.)

## Iteration 4 — castxml L2/L4 validation (does the right backend fix the empty surface?)

Installed castxml 0.6.3 (apt) to test whether L2 header AST + L4 decl/type yield materializes.

### Findings
- **POSITIVE (C libs)** With castxml present + the build's include dir, `-H` L2 works:
  `zlib.h` (+`-I build/` for generated `zconf.h`) → **21 types / 328 functions** captured —
  a real upgrade from `elf_only` to header-aware type info. So P04's hard-error was purely the
  missing tool; the feature works for C.
- **P14 [DISCOVERY/high]** The `-H` castxml path does **not inherit include paths from the
  compile DB**. snappy's public `snappy.h` `#include`s the *build-generated*
  `snappy-stubs-public.h`; L2 fails `fatal error: file not found` until you manually add
  `-I <builddir>`. Public headers routinely include generated headers — abicheck should feed
  the compile-DB include dirs into the castxml invocation automatically. *Fix idea:* derive
  `-I` from the matched compile unit's flags.
- **P15 [USABILITY/high — biggest C++ blocker]** castxml 0.6.3 **cannot parse libstdc++ 13**:
  snappy (after fixing includes) dies in `/usr/include/c++/13/bits/basic_string.h` template
  instantiation. Any C++ library that includes `<string>`/`<vector>`/etc. (≈ all of them) fails
  L2/L4 via castxml on a modern GCC stdlib. The clang L4 extractor avoids this but yields empty
  decl tables (P05). Net: **getting real C++ source-ABI facts is currently impractical** with a
  current toolchain — the castxml backend needs a matching/older libstdc++ or a clang-based
  decl extractor. This is the #1 thing blocking L2/L4 value on real C++ code.
- **P16 [USABILITY/low]** `--lang c` on `zlib.h` mis-fires "header appears to contain C++ syntax"
  and hard-fails (zlib.h is C with `extern "C"` guards). The heuristic should warn, not abort;
  default `--lang c++` parsed it fine.

### Timings (iteration 4)
- castxml L2 (zlib, success): 0.43s | castxml C++ failures: ~0.6s (fail fast)

---

## Open backlog for later iterations
- Install meson `builddir` discovery edge (P12), ninja/bazel adapters (pre-captured aquery).
- gcc-vs-clang `DW_AT_producer` toolchain capture via DWARF-bearing conda libs (libuv/openblas/bzip2).
- `collect`, `compare-release`, `surface-report`, `stack-check`, `appcompat` command coverage.
- Parallel-TU L4 timing experiment (validate P06 fix headroom).
- More C++ libs once a castxml/libstdc++-compatible combo or clang decl extractor is sorted (P15).

## Iteration 5 — LLVM FULL --sources scan (build options + source graph + L4 reality)

llvm-project @ llvmorg-18.1.8, source-level (the full L3/L4/L5 `--sources` flow).

| stage | time | result |
|---|---|---|
| clone (blobless `--depth 1`) | 153s | 2.1 GB checkout |
| cmake configure (Ninja, X86) | 19s | **2,719 compile units**, command-string DB |
| **L3 build data** | **4.4s** | 2,719 compile_units, **build_options=6**, snap 8.4MB |
| **L5 source graph (from L3, no L4)** | **3.57s** | **5,442 nodes** (2719 compile_unit + 2716 source + 7 build_option), **13,547 edges** (COMPILE_UNIT_BUILDS_SOURCE 2719, COMPILE_UNIT_USES_OPTION 10828) |
| L4 source replay (sample) | ~4s/parsing-TU | 3/4 lib TUs **fail** (missing tablegen `.inc`) |

**Headline:** building **build options + the full source graph on LLVM takes ~8s** (4.4 + 3.6),
*not* hours. The hours-long part is exclusively L4 source-ABI replay.

### Problems found
- **P17 [DISCOVERY/high] confirmed at scale** Command-string compile DBs (CMake+Ninja default,
  what LLVM and zstd produce) yield almost no build options: **6 from 2,719 TUs** for LLVM, 0 for
  zstd. The adapter normalizes flags well from `arguments[]`-form DBs (meson, snappy) but barely
  parses the `command` string form. Since CMake+Ninja is the most common real setup, build-option
  capture is effectively broken for most projects. *Fix:* shlex-split and normalize `command`.
- **P18 [USABILITY/med]** The CLI couples L5→L4 (`--collect-mode` source-*/graph-* all run L4),
  but the L3-derived source graph (compile_unit/source/**build_option** nodes + edges) needs **no
  source parsing** and builds in 3.6s on LLVM. There's no CLI mode for "L3 + L5 graph, skip L4",
  so a user wanting the build-options graph on a monorepo is forced into the hours-long L4 path
  (or must call `collect_inline_pack(layers=("L3","L5"))` directly, as I did). *Fix:* add a
  `graph-build` collect-mode (L3+L5, no L4).
- **P19 [DISCOVERY/high]** L4 source replay requires **generated headers to exist**. LLVM TUs
  `#include "llvm/IR/Attributes.inc"` (tablegen output); a configure-only tree fails every such
  TU with `fatal error: ...Attributes.inc: No such file or directory`. So L4 is gated on a real
  (partial) build, not just `cmake` configure — and abicheck surfaces it as a generic parse
  failure, not "generated header missing; build the target first."
- **P13 quantified** Full L4 on LLVM ≈ **50 min (serial, optimistic) to ~3 h** (2,719 TUs ×
  ~4s/parsing-TU, header-heavy). Only feasible scoped (changed-TU) + parallel + on a built tree.

### Timings (iteration 5)
- clone 153s · configure 19s · L3 4.4s · L5-graph-from-L3 3.6s · L4 ~4s/TU (needs built tree)

## Iteration 6 — oneDAL (Intel) full scan

`dal` 2025.9.0 → 2026.1.0. Binary scan matched on `libonedal_core`:

| | |
|---|---|
| SONAME | libonedal_core.so.**3** → .so.**4** (deliberate major bump) |
| sizes | 110MB → 105MB; function count omitted pending regenerated dynsym-only measurement |
| dump | 8.7s / 5.4s | compare | 9.1s |
| verdict | **BREAKING**: 8,104 breaking, 6,368 func_removed, vtable_slot_count_changed×1, **soname_changed×1** |

abicheck correctly pairs the deliberate SONAME bump with the wall of removals — a maintainer
*signalled* break, not an accidental one.

### Problems found
- **P20 [DISCOVERY/high]** Multi-`.so` packages: a "pick the biggest .so" heuristic picks
  *different libraries* across versions. My first pass compared `libonedal_dpc.so.3` (old, 298MB,
  SYCL variant) vs `libonedal_core.so.4` (new) → a meaningless 2.4% result. You must pair by
  library-name/SONAME stem, not size. A real footgun for anyone scanning bundles (oneDAL ships
  libonedal, _core, _dpc, _thread, _parameters). abicheck's `compare-release`/bundle mode should
  be the recommended path here, not hand-picking a `.so`.
- **P21 [DISCOVERY/high]** oneDAL build/source (L3/L4) is **infeasible without the full Intel
  toolchain**. Build system = **Bazel + legacy makefile, no CMake**, no in-tree
  `compile_commands.json` generator. L3 would need either `bazel aquery` (needs bazel + DPC++/icpx
  toolchain resolution) or `bear -- make` (needs a full build: oneMKL + TBB + DPC++). So for
  heavyweight projects the artifact (L0/L1) scan is the only practical path in a generic CI box;
  source/build data requires the project's own build environment. (Clone was cheap: 3s/68MB.)

---

## L4 source-replay optimization — the options (answering "how not to be so lengthy")

L4 cost = (number of TUs) × (per-TU clang parse). Both factors are reducible:

1. **Scope to changed TUs** *(biggest lever; already in-tree)* — `--collect-mode source-changed` /
   `recommend-collect-mode` replays only TUs touched by a PR diff. LLVM PR touching 5 files → 5 TUs,
   not 2,719. Turns hours into seconds for the common CI case.
2. **Parallelize per-TU clang** *(P06; not yet done)* — the replay is embarrassingly parallel;
   N cores ≈ N× speedup. 50min → ~12min on 4 cores, less on CI runners.
3. **Per-TU content-addressed cache** *(ADR-030 D8 `SourceAbiCache`, already in-tree via
   `build_cache_dir`)* — unchanged TUs skip re-parse across runs; incremental builds near-free.
4. **Precompiled headers / Clang modules** — header re-parsing dominates header-heavy TUs (LLVM
   ~4s/TU is mostly the same headers re-read). A shared PCH amortizes it; potentially 5–10× per-TU.
5. **Surface-reachability pruning** — only replay TUs that define exported public symbols (walk
   public-header → symbol map); skip unit tests / internal TUs. On LLVM, `unittests/**` is dead
   weight for libLLVM's ABI.
6. **Decouple L5 from L4** *(P18)* — if you only need build options + the structural graph, build
   L5 from L3 alone (seconds, no parse). Add a `graph-build` collect-mode.
7. **Lighter extractor / decl-only mode** — castxml-style declaration/type extraction is cheaper
   than clang full-body fingerprints when you don't need inline/template body diffs.

**Recommended default:** scope=changed + cache + parallel for CI; full-target only on releases,
and never on a monorepo without scoping.

## Why CI didn't catch the 2 mypy errors (#367/#368)
CI installs mypy **unpinned** (`pyproject` `mypy>=1.0`; `ci.yml` does `pip install mypy` and
`pip install -e ".[dev,mcp]" mypy`). The type gate therefore uses whatever mypy is latest on the
run date — non-reproducible across time. The two patterns (`getattr(object,...)[k]` returning
`Any` → `no-any-return`; passing `object` where a `HasKind` Protocol is expected → `arg-type`) are
flagged by current mypy (1.19.1) but slipped through whatever version ran on #367/#368. *Fix:* pin
mypy to an exact version in `[dev]` and CI so the gate is deterministic. (The 2 errors are now fixed
→ baseline back to 0.)

## Correction (Codex P2, batch2.py symbol counter)
Earlier `funcs` columns in iterations 2/3/6 were produced by `readelf -sW --dyn-syms | grep ' FUNC '`,
which **double-counts** (`.symtab` + `.dynsym`) and includes **UND imports** — inflating counts
~3–5×. Real defined-export counts are lower (e.g. **libLLVM.so.18 = 30,913** defined FUNC exports,
not 153,115). The counter is fixed (dyn table only, FUNC + defined + GLOBAL/WEAK), and iteration-2
data/table rows were regenerated; iteration-3 and iteration-6 headline counts were removed or
marked corrected until their rows are regenerated. **Verdicts and change-counts are unaffected by the helper counter**
— those come from abicheck's own dynsym parsing, not this helper. The relative scale story (small C →
ICU → LLVM → oneDAL) holds; only the absolute `funcs` headline was off.
