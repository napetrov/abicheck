"""Mutation-score gate — baseline-drift check for the core detector modules.

Mutation testing is the direct answer to "are these tests generalized, or do
they just execute lines without checking the result?". ``mutmut`` mutates the
detector logic (the modules listed under ``[tool.mutmut]`` in pyproject.toml)
and re-runs the suite; a *surviving* mutant is a line that is covered but not
actually verified by any assertion — exactly the coverage-filling failure mode.

This script runs (or reads) ``mutmut`` results, counts survivors, and compares
them to a documented baseline, the same way ``check_ai_readiness.py`` guards
the mypy error count:

* survivors **above** the baseline  -> ERROR (a test regressed / weakened);
* survivors **below** the baseline  -> note to lower the baseline deliberately;
* baseline **unset**                -> report-only (used to establish the first
  number on a scheduled run, since a full mutmut pass is too slow for every PR).

Because a full mutation run is minutes-to-hours, this is wired as a scheduled /
on-demand lane (``.github/workflows/mutation.yml``), not a per-PR gate.

Usage::

    # Run mutmut then check (CI, scheduled):
    python scripts/check_mutation_score.py --run --baseline 0

    # Check an existing run's output:
    mutmut results | python scripts/check_mutation_score.py --results-file -

The survivor-count *parser* is pure and unit-tested
(``tests/test_mutation_score_gate.py``) so the gate logic stays correct even on
machines without mutmut installed.
