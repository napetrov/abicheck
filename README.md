# abicheck

**abicheck checks C/C++ library compatibility at both API and ABI levels.**

abicheck is inspired by two foundational projects:

- [libabigail / abidiff](https://sourceware.org/libabigail/)
- [ABI Compliance Checker (ABICC)](https://lvc.github.io/abi-compliance-checker/)

Many thanks and kudos to both communities for defining the practical ABI-checking ecosystem.
Sadly, both projects are effectively no longer maintained for many modern contributor workflows,
and it is often not practical to land new fixes there. abicheck is designed to be a
**drop-in replacement for ABICC** while providing a modern, maintainable Python codebase.

## Requirements

### Mandatory

- Python 3.10+
- `castxml` (for header-based C/C++ API parsing)
- A C/C++ compiler available to castxml (`g++` or `clang++`)

### Runtime Python dependencies

- `click` (CLI)
- `pyelftools` (ELF/DWARF metadata extraction)
- `defusedxml` (safe ABICC XML parsing)

---

## How to use abicheck

### 1) Create ABI snapshots

```bash
abicheck dump libfoo.so.1 -H include/foo.h --version 1.0 -o libfoo-1.0.json
abicheck dump libfoo.so.2 -H include/foo.h --version 2.0 -o libfoo-2.0.json
```

### 2) Compare snapshots

```bash
# Markdown report (default)
abicheck compare libfoo-1.0.json libfoo-2.0.json

# JSON
abicheck compare libfoo-1.0.json libfoo-2.0.json --format json -o report.json

# SARIF
abicheck compare libfoo-1.0.json libfoo-2.0.json --format sarif -o report.sarif
```

### 3) ABICC-compatible mode

```bash
# Minimal (same flags as abi-compliance-checker):
abicheck compat -lib foo -old old.xml -new new.xml

# Full flag parity:
abicheck compat -lib foo -old old.xml -new new.xml \
  -report-path report.html \
  -s \
  -show-retval \
  -v1 1.0 -v2 2.0
```

This mode supports ABICC-style descriptor workflows so teams can migrate without
rewriting their entire pipeline on day one. See [ABICC compatibility reference](docs/abicc_compat.md) for full flag list.

## abicheck as a drop-in replacement for ABICC

abicheck keeps the ABICC descriptor-driven model available (`compat` mode), while adding:

- Native JSON/SARIF/Markdown outputs for automation
- Easier CI embedding in Python-based tooling
- More explicit architecture with reusable Python modules
- Cleaner evolution path for new ABI rules and checks
- **Superset detectors** — finds everything ABICC finds, plus more (see [gap report](docs/gap_report.md))

### Migration: one-line swap

```bash
# Before:
abi-compliance-checker -lib libdnnl -old old.xml -new new.xml -report-path r.html

# After (identical):
abicheck compat -lib libdnnl -old old.xml -new new.xml -report-path r.html
```

### Supported ABICC flags

| Flag | Alias(es) | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `-lib NAME` | `-l`, `-library` | Library name |
| `-old PATH` | `-d1` | Old version descriptor |
| `-new PATH` | `-d2` | New version descriptor |
| `-report-path PATH` | | Output report path |
| `-report-format FMT` | | `html` / `json` / `md` (default: `html`) |
| `-s` | `-strict` | Any change → exit 1 (BREAKING) |
| `-source` | `-src`, `-api` | Source/API compat only (filter ELF-only changes) |
| `-binary` | `-bin`, `-abi` | Binary ABI mode (default) |
| `-show-retval` | | Include return-value changes in report |
| `-v1 NUM` | `-vnum1` | Override old version label |
| `-v2 NUM` | `-vnum2` | Override new version label |
| `-title NAME` | | Custom report title |
| `-skip-symbols PATH` | | File with symbols to suppress |
| `-skip-types PATH` | | File with types to suppress |
| `-stdout` | | Print report to stdout |
| `-headers-only` | | _(reserved — not yet implemented)_ |
| `-skip-headers PATH` | | _(reserved — not yet implemented)_ |

Practical migration path:

1. Keep your existing XML descriptor generation.
2. Replace ABICC CLI call with `abicheck compat`.
3. Move to `dump` + `compare` when you want explicit snapshot control and richer outputs.

### Tooling summary

- `abidiff + headers`: strong at ABI diffs when debug/header context is good.
- `ABICC #2` (headers): useful semantic/header-driven mode, with GCC-oriented legacy behavior.
- `ABICC #1` (abi-dumper): strong DWARF pipeline, but depends on debug builds.
- **abicheck**: combines practical header + ELF checks, ABICC compatibility mode,
  and CI-native outputs for production pipelines.

  --cov=abicheck --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=xml --cov-fail-under=52

# full local suite (includes integration/parity when deps are present)
pytest --cov=abicheck --cov-report=term-missing
```

Coverage settings are centralized in `pyproject.toml` and CI publishes `coverage.xml` as an artifact.
