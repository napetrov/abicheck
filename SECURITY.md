We aim to respond within 72 hours and release a fix within 14 days for confirmed issues.

## Security considerations

- abicheck parses ELF binaries and DWARF debug info from potentially untrusted sources.
  Use `--suppress` and policy files from trusted sources only.
- **ELF/DWARF parsing**: Malformed or adversarially crafted ELF binaries may trigger
  bugs in the underlying `pyelftools` library. When analyzing third-party or untrusted
  binaries, run abicheck in a sandboxed/isolated environment.
- ABICC XML descriptors are parsed with `defusedxml` to prevent XML entity expansion attacks.
- Suppression patterns use Python `re` with `re.fullmatch` to limit matching scope.
- Policy files (YAML) are loaded with `yaml.safe_load` — no arbitrary code execution.
