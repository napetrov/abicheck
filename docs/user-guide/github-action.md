# GitHub Action

abicheck ships as a reusable GitHub Action that you can add to any CI pipeline
with a few lines of YAML. It installs Python, system dependencies, and abicheck
automatically, then runs ABI comparison and reports results.

## Quick start

```yaml
- uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1
  with:
    old-library: abi-baseline.json
    new-library: build/libfoo.so
    new-header: include/foo.h
```

## Usage examples

### Compare two libraries on a PR

```yaml
name: ABI Check
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  abi-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build library
        run: mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make

      - name: Check ABI compatibility
        uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1
        with:
          old-library: abi-baseline.json  # committed to repo
          new-library: build/libfoo.so
          new-header: include/foo.h
          new-version: pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
```

### Save a baseline on release

The baseline is a JSON snapshot of the library's ABI surface. Generate it when
you release a version, then compare against it on every PR.

```yaml
name: ABI Baseline
on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  save-baseline:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build library
        run: mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make

      - name: Dump ABI baseline
        uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1
        with:
          mode: dump
          new-library: build/libfoo.so
          header: include/foo.h
          new-version: ${{ github.ref_name }}
          output-file: abi-baseline.json

      - name: Upload baseline as release asset
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2
        with:
          files: abi-baseline.json
```

### Download baseline and compare on PR

```yaml
      - name: Download baseline from latest release
        run: gh release download --pattern 'abi-baseline.json' --dir .
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Check ABI
        uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1
        with:
          old-library: abi-baseline.json
          new-library: build/libfoo.so
          new-header: include/foo.h
```

### Use GitHub Actions cache for baseline

```yaml
      - name: Restore cached baseline
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: abi-baseline.json
          key: abi-baseline-${{ github.event.repository.default_branch }}-${{ github.sha }}
          restore-keys: |
            abi-baseline-${{ github.event.repository.default_branch }}-

      - name: Check ABI
        uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1
        with:
          old-library: abi-baseline.json
          new-library: build/libfoo.so
          new-header: include/foo.h
```

### SARIF with GitHub Code Scanning

Upload results to the Security tab so ABI breaks appear as code scanning alerts.

!!! note
    Requires `security-events: write` permission. On PRs, GitHub only shows
    **new** alerts introduced by the PR — existing alerts stay on the default
    branch and don't clutter the review.

```yaml
jobs:
  abi-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      security-events: write
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make

      - uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1
        with:
          old-library: abi-baseline.json
          new-library: build/libfoo.so
          new-header: include/foo.h
          format: sarif
          upload-sarif: true
```

### Cross-compilation check (dump mode)

Cross-compilation flags (`gcc-prefix`, `sysroot`, `gcc-options`) are only supported
in `dump` mode. Use `mode: dump` to generate a baseline from a cross-compiled binary,
then compare with a separate step.

```yaml
      # Step 1: dump ABI snapshot from cross-compiled binary
      - uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1
        with:
          mode: dump
          new-library: build-arm64/libfoo.so
          header: include/foo.h
          gcc-prefix: aarch64-linux-gnu-
          sysroot: /usr/aarch64-linux-gnu
          lang: c
          output-file: baseline-arm64.json
```

### Matrix: multiple libraries

```yaml
    strategy:
      matrix:
        lib:
          - { name: libfoo, so: build/libfoo.so, header: include/foo.h }
          - { name: libbar, so: build/libbar.so, header: include/bar.h }
    steps:
      - uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1
        with:
          old-library: baselines/${{ matrix.lib.name }}.json
          new-library: ${{ matrix.lib.so }}
          new-header: ${{ matrix.lib.header }}
```

### Matrix: multiple platforms (native scan per OS)

Use native runners to get the best platform-specific signal (Linux/ELF, macOS/Mach-O, Windows/PE):

```yaml
jobs:
  abi-scan:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        include:
          - os: ubuntu-latest
            ext: so
          - os: macos-latest
            ext: dylib
          - os: windows-latest
            ext: dll
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Build your platform artifact here (example command only)
      - name: Build
        run: |
          echo "build on ${{ matrix.os }}"

      - name: ABI compare (native)
        uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1
        with:
          old-library: baselines/${{ runner.os }}/abi-old.json
          new-library: build/${{ runner.os }}/libfoo.${{ matrix.ext }}
          new-header: include/foo.h
          format: json
          output-file: abi-report-${{ runner.os }}.json

      - name: Upload platform ABI report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: abi-report-${{ runner.os }}
          path: abi-report-${{ runner.os }}.json
```

### Skip system dependency installation

If `castxml` + compiler are already available (custom image, pre-provisioned VM,
or conda-forge environment), set `install-deps: false`:

```yaml
      - uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1
        with:
          old-library: old.json
          new-library: new.json
          install-deps: false
```

Example (conda-forge pre-step):

```yaml
      - name: Install abicheck from conda-forge
        run: |
          conda install -y -c conda-forge abicheck

      - uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1
        with:
          old-library: old.json
          new-library: new.json
          install-deps: false
```

When comparing two JSON snapshots, no header-analysis toolchain is needed.

### Full-stack dependency check on container image update

Validate that updating a base image doesn't break your application's dependency
stack. This runs `stack-check` to compare the binary's full transitive
dependency tree across old and new container root filesystems:

```yaml
jobs:
  stack-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Extract old rootfs
        run: |
          mkdir -p /tmp/old-root
          docker export $(docker create old-image:latest) | tar -xf - -C /tmp/old-root

      - name: Extract new rootfs
        run: |
          mkdir -p /tmp/new-root
          docker export $(docker create new-image:latest) | tar -xf - -C /tmp/new-root

      - name: Full-stack ABI check
        uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1
        with:
          mode: stack-check
          new-library: usr/bin/myapp
          baseline: /tmp/old-root
          candidate: /tmp/new-root
          format: json
          output-file: stack-report.json
```

Exit codes for `stack-check`: `0` = PASS, `1` = WARN (ABI risk), `4` = FAIL (load failure or ABI break).

### Dependency tree audit

Show the resolved dependency tree and symbol binding status for a binary.
Useful for auditing which libraries a binary actually loads and detecting
missing dependencies before deployment:

```yaml
      - name: Audit dependencies
        uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1
        with:
          mode: deps
          new-library: build/myapp
          sysroot: /path/to/target/rootfs
```

### Include dependency info in compare

Add `follow-deps: true` to include the transitive dependency graph and symbol
binding information alongside the regular ABI diff:

```yaml
      - name: Compare with dependency context
        uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1
        with:
          old-library: baseline.json
          new-library: build/libfoo.so
          new-header: include/foo.h
          follow-deps: true
```

### Conditional failure

Allow API breaks but block binary ABI breaks:

```yaml
      - uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1
        with:
          old-library: baseline.json
          new-library: build/libfoo.so
          new-header: include/foo.h
          fail-on-breaking: true
          fail-on-api-break: false
```

### Detect unintentional API expansion

Block PRs that accidentally add new public symbols or types:

```yaml
      - uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1
        with:
          old-library: baseline.json
          new-library: build/libfoo.so
          new-header: include/foo.h
          fail-on-breaking: true
          severity-addition: error   # exit code 1 if any new public API appears
```

When `severity-addition: error`:
- Exit code `1` → new public symbol/type added (`verdict: SEVERITY_ERROR`)
- Exit code `0` → no additions, no breaks (`verdict: COMPATIBLE`)
- Exit code `4` → binary ABI break (`verdict: BREAKING`)

This is useful when your library has a stable frozen API and any expansion
must be a deliberate, reviewed decision rather than an accidental side effect.

### Compare RPM packages

Use `mode: compare-release` to compare all shared libraries inside two packages
without manual extraction. Supported formats: RPM, Deb, tar (`.tar.gz`,
`.tar.xz`, `.tar.bz2`, `.tgz`), conda (`.conda`, `.tar.bz2`), wheel (`.whl`),
and plain directories.

```yaml
      - name: Compare RPM packages
        uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1
        with:
          mode: compare-release
          old-library: libfoo-1.0-1.el9.x86_64.rpm
          new-library: libfoo-1.1-1.el9.x86_64.rpm
```

### Compare packages with debug info

Provide separate debug info packages for full type-level analysis via
build-id resolution:

```yaml
      - name: Compare with debug info
        uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1
        with:
          mode: compare-release
          old-library: libfoo-1.0.rpm
          new-library: libfoo-1.1.rpm
          debug-info1: libfoo-debuginfo-1.0.rpm
          debug-info2: libfoo-debuginfo-1.1.rpm
```

### Compare Deb packages with development headers

```yaml
      - name: Compare Deb packages
        uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1
        with:
          mode: compare-release
          old-library: libfoo1_1.0-1_amd64.deb
          new-library: libfoo1_1.1-1_amd64.deb
          devel-pkg1: libfoo-dev_1.0-1_amd64.deb
          devel-pkg2: libfoo-dev_1.1-1_amd64.deb
```

### Compare tar archives (DSOs only)

```yaml
      - name: Compare SDK tarballs
        uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1
        with:
          mode: compare-release
          old-library: sdk-2.0.tar.gz
          new-library: sdk-2.1.tar.gz
          dso-only: true
```

### Compare conda packages

```yaml
      - name: Compare conda packages
        uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1
        with:
          mode: compare-release
          old-library: pkg-v1.conda
          new-library: pkg-v2.conda
```

### Application compatibility check

Check whether your application binary is affected by a library update:

```yaml
      - uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1
        with:
          mode: appcompat
          app-binary: build/myapp
          old-library: libfoo.so.1
          new-library: build/libfoo.so.2
          header: include/foo.h
```

### Quick symbol availability check (weak mode)

Verify a library provides all symbols an application needs — no old library required:

```yaml
      - uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1
        with:
          mode: appcompat
          app-binary: build/myapp
          check-against: build/libfoo.so
          install-deps: false
```

## Versioning

The action follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) with floating
major version tags:

```yaml
uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1         # latest stable v1.x.x (recommended)
uses: napetrov/abicheck@v1.2.0     # exact version (reproducible)
uses: napetrov/abicheck@abc123def  # exact commit SHA (most secure)
```

The `v1` tag is updated with each patch/minor release. Breaking changes to
the action interface will increment to `v2`.
