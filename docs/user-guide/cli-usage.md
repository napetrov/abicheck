# Using abicheck, Compatibility Modes, and Coverage

## What abicheck is

**abicheck** checks C/C++ library compatibility on both API and ABI layers.
It is designed to be a practical, modern replacement for legacy ABI tooling in CI,
especially when you need structured output and automation.

abicheck is inspired by:

- [libabigail / abidiff](https://sourceware.org/libabigail/)
- [ABI Compliance Checker (ABICC)](https://lvc.github.io/abi-compliance-checker/)

Huge thanks to both projects for pioneering ABI compatibility analysis.

## How to use abicheck

### 1) Compare two libraries directly (primary flow)

The simplest way — pass `.so` files and their public headers directly to
`compare`. Each library version gets its own header(s):

```bash
# Each version has its own header
abicheck compare libfoo.so.1 libfoo.so.2 \
  --old-header include/v1/foo.h --new-header include/v2/foo.h

# Multiple headers per version, with include dirs and version labels
abicheck compare libfoo.so.1 libfoo.so.2 \
  --old-header include/v1/foo.h --old-header include/v1/bar.h \
  --new-header include/v2/foo.h --new-header include/v2/bar.h \
  -I include/ --old-version 1.0 --new-version 2.0

# Shorthand: -H applies the same header to both sides
# (only when the header itself didn't change between versions)
abicheck compare libfoo.so.1 libfoo.so.2 -H include/foo.h

# Header directory input is supported (recursive)
abicheck compare libfoo.so.1 libfoo.so.2 -H include/

# Output formats
abicheck compare libfoo.so.1 libfoo.so.2 \
  --old-header v1/foo.h --new-header v2/foo.h --format sarif -o abi.sarif
```

`compare` auto-detects each input: `.so` files are dumped on-the-fly, `.json`
snapshots and ABICC Perl dumps (Data::Dumper `.dump` files) are loaded directly.
You can mix them freely (see below).

If ELF headers are not provided, `compare` falls back to symbols-only analysis
and prints a warning. This mode is useful for quick checks but may miss
signature/type-level ABI breaks.

### 2) Dump snapshots and compare later (for CI baselines)

When you want to cache ABI baselines as CI artifacts or commit them to the repo:

```bash
# Step 1: Dump snapshots (each version uses its own header)
abicheck dump libfoo.so.1 -H include/v1/foo.h --version 1.0 -o libfoo-1.0.json
abicheck dump libfoo.so.2 -H include/v2/foo.h --version 2.0 -o libfoo-2.0.json

# Step 2: Compare snapshots (no headers needed — already baked in)
abicheck compare libfoo-1.0.json libfoo-2.0.json
```

#### Language mode

By default castxml uses C++ mode. For pure C libraries, pass `--lang c`:

```bash
abicheck dump libfoo.so -H foo.h --lang c -o snap.json
abicheck compare libv1.so libv2.so -H foo.h --lang c
```

#### Cross-compilation

When analysing libraries built for a different architecture, pass cross-compilation
flags to `dump`:

```bash
abicheck dump libfoo.so -H include/foo.h \
  --gcc-prefix aarch64-linux-gnu- \
  --sysroot /opt/sysroots/aarch64 \
  --gcc-options "-march=armv8-a" \
  -o snap.json

# Or specify the cross-compiler binary directly:
abicheck dump libfoo.so -H include/foo.h \
  --gcc-path /usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-g++ \
  -o snap.json
```

Available cross-compilation flags:
- `--gcc-path` — path to the cross-compiler binary
- `--gcc-prefix` — toolchain prefix (e.g. `aarch64-linux-gnu-`)
- `--gcc-options` — extra compiler flags passed to castxml
- `--sysroot` — alternative system root directory
- `--nostdinc` — do not search standard system include paths

#### Verbose output

Add `-v` / `--verbose` to any native command to enable debug logging:

```bash
abicheck dump libfoo.so -H foo.h -v
abicheck compare old.json new.json -v
```

### Report filtering and display options

`compare` provides several flags to control what is shown in the report.
These flags are **display-only** — they do not affect the verdict or exit codes.

#### Redundancy filtering

By default, abicheck collapses derived changes caused by a root type change.
For example, if a struct's size changes, the 30 `FUNC_PARAMS_CHANGED` entries
for functions that take that struct are hidden. The root type change is annotated
with the count and list of affected interfaces.

```bash
# Show all changes, including redundant derived ones
abicheck compare old.json new.json --show-redundant
```

#### `--show-only`: filter displayed changes

Limit which changes appear in the report using three dimensions (AND across
dimensions, OR within):

- **Severity**: `breaking`, `api-break`, `risk`, `compatible`
- **Element**: `functions`, `variables`, `types`, `enums`, `elf`
- **Action**: `added`, `removed`, `changed`

```bash
# Only breaking function removals
abicheck compare old.json new.json --show-only breaking,functions,removed

# All type changes (any action, any severity)
abicheck compare old.json new.json --show-only types

# Breaking + risk changes only
abicheck compare old.json new.json --show-only breaking,risk
```

Invalid tokens are caught immediately with a clear error message.

#### Severity configuration (`--severity-*`)

Control exit codes and report labels by assigning severity levels to four issue
categories:

```bash
# Block on API additions
abicheck compare old.json new.json --severity-addition error

# Everything is an error (strict)
abicheck compare old.json new.json --severity-preset strict

# Custom: breaks are errors, additions are warnings, rest is info
abicheck compare old.json new.json \
  --severity-abi-breaking error \
  --severity-potential-breaking info \
  --severity-quality-issues info \
  --severity-addition warning
```

See the [severity guide](severity.md) for the full reference.

#### `--stat`: one-line CI summary

```bash
# Human-readable one-liner
abicheck compare old.json new.json --stat
# BREAKING: 3 breaking, 1 risk (42 total) [12 redundant hidden]

# JSON summary (no changes array)
abicheck compare old.json new.json --stat --format json
```

#### `--report-mode leaf`: root-type-grouped output

Groups output by root type changes, listing affected interfaces under each:

```bash
abicheck compare old.json new.json --report-mode leaf
```

This is useful for large diffs where you want to understand the root causes
rather than reading hundreds of individual change entries.

#### `--show-impact`: impact summary table

Appends a summary table showing which root type changes affected the most
interfaces:

```bash
abicheck compare old.json new.json --show-impact
```

All filtering flags work with the main `compare` command output formats:
Markdown, JSON, SARIF, and HTML. The ABICC-compatible XML output (produced via
`abicheck compat check`) does not support `--show-only` filtering, though it
does include redundancy annotations (`<redundant_changes>`, `<caused_by>`,
`<caused_count>`).

### 3) Mixed mode: snapshot baseline vs live build

```bash
# CI baseline snapshot vs current build
abicheck compare baseline-1.0.json ./build/libfoo.so \
  --new-header include/foo.h --new-version 2.0-dev

# Live old build vs stored new snapshot
abicheck compare ./build-old/libfoo.so new-release.json \
  --old-header include/foo.h --old-version 1.0-rc1
```

### 4) ABICC-compatible invocation (for migration)

For teams migrating from `abi-compliance-checker` — same flags, same XML descriptors.
See [ABICC compatibility reference](from-abicc.md) for the full flag list.

```bash
# Minimal (identical to abi-compliance-checker):
abicheck compat check -lib foo -old old.xml -new new.xml

# With strict mode and version labels:
abicheck compat check -lib foo -old old.xml -new new.xml -s -v1 1.0 -v2 2.0

# Source/API compat only (ignore ELF metadata):
abicheck compat check -lib foo -old old.xml -new new.xml -source

# Skip known symbols:
abicheck compat check -lib foo -old old.xml -new new.xml -skip-symbols skip.txt
```

## abicheck as a drop-in replacement for ABICC

abicheck intentionally supports ABICC-like CLI semantics and XML descriptor flow,
while modernizing internals and outputs.

### Why teams replace ABICC with abicheck

- Python-native implementation, easier to embed and extend in CI.
- Structured outputs (`json`, `markdown`, `sarif`) for machine + human consumption.
- Works well in stripped-binary workflows when combined with headers.
- Better integration path for modern C++ workflows and policy checks.
- **Full ABICC flag parity** — `-s/-strict`, `-source`, `-skip-symbols/-skip-types`, `-v1/-v2`, `-stdout` and more.
- **Superset detectors** — catches everything ABICC catches plus: `FUNC_DELETED`, `VAR_BECAME_CONST`, `TYPE_BECAME_OPAQUE`, `BASE_CLASS_POSITION_CHANGED`, `BASE_CLASS_VIRTUAL_CHANGED`.

### Practical migration path

1. Keep your existing ABICC XML descriptor generation.
2. Replace ABICC compare call with `abicheck compat check ...` (flags are identical).
3. Optionally move to native `dump/compare` commands for explicit snapshot control.
4. Switch CI gates to JSON/SARIF-based policy checks.

## Change classification: BREAKING vs COMPATIBLE

abicheck classifies every detected change into a verdict:

- **BREAKING** — binary ABI incompatibility; existing binaries will malfunction.
- **COMPATIBLE** — informational/warning; does not break binary compatibility on its own.
- **NO_CHANGE** — identical ABI.

A change is BREAKING only when it causes binary-level failures: symbol resolution errors,
type layout corruption, vtable mismatch, or calling convention incompatibility.

Changes like `noexcept` addition/removal, enum member addition, union field addition,
GLOBAL→WEAK binding, and IFUNC transitions are classified as **COMPATIBLE** — they are
detected and reported for awareness but do not trigger a BREAKING verdict. See the
[ABI Break Catalog](../concepts/breaking-cases-catalog.md) for the full
rationale table.

## ABI/API breakages and what each tool mode can detect

This section maps breakage types to example cases under `examples/` and compares:

- `abicheck` (header + ELF metadata pipeline)
- `abidiff + headers`
- `ABICC Usage #2` (header-based ABICC mode)
- `ABICC Usage #1` (abi-dumper / DWARF dump mode)

Legend: ✅ strong support, ⚠️ partial/conditional, ❌ generally not covered.

### Summary by breakage category

- **API surface breaks** (removed/changed signatures): all modes generally catch these.
- **C++ semantic contract breaks** (`noexcept`, inline/ODR): header-aware analysis is strongest.
- **DWARF-only detail** (some anonymous/internal layout details): ABICC dump mode can be strongest when debug info exists.
- **Policy/linking hygiene** (SONAME/versioning/visibility): best handled by a tool that includes explicit ELF policy checks.

## Architecture and dependencies

### 5) Full-stack dependency validation (Linux ELF)

Resolve the full dependency tree, simulate symbol binding, and produce a
stack-level ABI compatibility verdict.

```bash
# Show dependency tree + symbol binding status
abicheck deps /usr/bin/python3
abicheck deps /usr/bin/python3 --format json

# Compare a binary's full stack across two sysroots
abicheck stack-check usr/bin/myapp \
    --baseline /rootfs/v1 --candidate /rootfs/v2

# Include dependency info in dump/compare
abicheck dump libfoo.so -H foo.h --follow-deps -o snap.json
abicheck compare old.so new.so -H foo.h --follow-deps
```

The `deps` command resolves the transitive dependency closure and displays:
- Dependency tree with resolution reasons (rpath, runpath, default, etc.)
- Unresolved libraries
- Symbol binding summary (resolved, missing, version mismatches)

The `stack-check` command compares two environments and reports:
- Loadability verdict (will the binary load?)
- ABI risk verdict (are there breaking changes in dependencies?)
- Per-library ABI diffs intersected with actual symbol usage

The `--follow-deps` flag on `dump` and `compare` includes dependency graph
and binding information in the output alongside the regular ABI diff.

## High-level architecture

```text
CLI
  dump                         — dump ABI snapshot to JSON
  compare                      — compare two ABI surfaces
  deps                         — show dependency tree + binding status (Linux ELF)
  stack-check                  — full-stack comparison across environments (Linux ELF)
  compat check                 — ABICC drop-in comparison
  compat dump                  — dump from ABICC XML descriptor
    -> dumper (castxml AST + ELF metadata)
    -> checker (rule-based diff + severity)
    -> resolver (transitive dependency resolution)
    -> binder (symbol binding simulation)
    -> stack_checker (stack-level ABI comparison)
    -> reporters (markdown/json/sarif/html)
```
