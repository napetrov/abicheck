# ADR-030: Source ABI Replay and Linked Source Surface

**Date:** 2026-06-09
**Status:** Proposed
**Decision maker:** Nikolay Petrov

---

## Context

Some API/ABI-relevant facts are weakly represented or absent in final
binary/debug artifacts:

- macro constants and feature macros;
- default arguments;
- inline function bodies and inline behavior fingerprints;
- `constexpr` and template-body changes;
- uninstantiated templates;
- source declarations that are never emitted into a symbol table;
- public header origin/provenance;
- generated headers and configuration-specific header contents.

ADR-026 made this boundary explicit: group-1 gaps are recovered by
supplying headers (the `header_aware` tier), while group-2 changes —
uninstantiated templates, never-included inline bodies — are invisible to
*any* artifact comparison and are documented as a known limitation
(`case122`). ADR-026 also recorded the one place a source pass earns its
keep: an optional pre-filter that operates on source with real context,
with artifact comparison remaining authoritative (ADR-025 D4).

This ADR fills that slot. It adds an **optional** source ABI replay layer
(L4 in the ADR-028 model) that parses selected translation units and public
headers under their real per-TU build context (from ADR-029
`BuildEvidence`) and links the result against the library's exported
surface.

**Boundary update relative to ADR-026.** ADR-026's non-goal — a standalone
source-AST comparator inside abicheck that replaces artifact comparison —
stands unchanged. What this ADR adds is narrower: an opt-in, build-context-
grounded source evidence layer whose findings are classified as source/API
risks, never as sole authority for shipped-ABI `BREAKING` verdicts (ADR-028
D3). The lightweight-core constraint (ADR-001) is preserved by making
castxml the first extractor and keeping Clang LibTooling optional.

The closest existing architecture is Android's header checker flow:
per-source ABI dumps are produced from compiled sources with exported
include directories and compiler flags, then linked into a library-level
ABI dump using a version script or the shared library's exported symbols,
then compared against references. abicheck reuses this pattern conceptually
without adopting Android's unstable intermediate formats as a public
contract.

---

## Decision

### D1. Add optional source ABI replay as L4 evidence

```text
BuildEvidence compile units (ADR-029)
  └── source ABI extractor per selected TU/header
        └── tu_source_abi/*.json
              └── source ABI linker
                    └── source/source_abi.json
                          └── compared as auxiliary evidence
```

The initial implementation works after a normal build, when sources and
build metadata already exist. It does not require compiler plugins or
instrumented rebuilds.

### D2. Parse with real per-TU build context

Source replay must use the same compile context as the real build whenever
possible:

- source file path and working directory;
- compiler frontend mode and language standard;
- defines/undefines;
- include paths and system include paths;
- target triple and sysroot;
- ABI-affecting compiler flags;
- generated headers that already exist in the build tree.

The compile context comes from ADR-029 `BuildEvidence`, not from manual
global flags. This is what separates replay from the naive source-AST
comparison ADR-025/026 reject: replay sees the headers the compiler
actually saw, under the flags it actually used.

### D3. Keep extractor implementation pluggable

Several extractors are supported behind one normalized `SourceAbiTu`
schema, via the ADR-032 extractor interface:

| Extractor | Integration | Use now? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| castxml replay | CLI invocation per public header/TU context | Short-term feasible | Reuses the existing dependency; good for declarations/types; weak for function bodies. |
| Clang LibTooling source dumper | abicheck-owned standalone tool or optional package | Preferred medium-term | Best control over AST, macros, source locations, inline/template fingerprints. |
| Android `header-abi-dumper` adapter | External CLI adapter | Optional/reference | Good precedent; raw `.sdump` is not stable enough for abicheck schema (D9). |
| clang-tidy custom check | Plugin-like source checker | Optional | Useful for source/API lint-style findings; not ideal as a dump format. |
| CodeQL/Kythe | External graph/database backend | Later | Too heavy for the source ABI MVP; useful for the graph layer (ADR-031). |

The normalized schema is authoritative; external tool formats are raw
provenance only (ADR-028 D4).

### D4. Define the `SourceAbiTu` normalized schema

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "tu_id": "cu://src/foo.cpp#cfg:abc123",
  "target_id": "target://libfoo",
  "extractor": {"name": "abicheck-clang-source-dumper", "version": "0.1"},
  "compile_context_hash": "sha256:...",
  "source": "src/foo.cpp",
  "public_header_roots": ["include/foo/foo.h"],
  "declarations": [],
  "types": [],
  "functions": [],
  "variables": [],
  "macros": [],
  "templates": [],
  "inline_bodies": [],
  "constexpr_values": [],
  "source_edges": [],
  "diagnostics": []
}
```

Entity fields:

```json
{
  "id": "decl://sha256...",
  "kind": "function|method|record|enum|typedef|variable|macro|template",
  "qualified_name": "foo::Bar::baz",
  "mangled_name": "_ZN3foo3Bar3bazEv",
  "signature_hash": "sha256:...",
  "body_hash": "sha256:...",
  "type_hash": "sha256:...",
  "source_location": {"path": "include/foo/bar.h", "line": 42, "origin": "PUBLIC_HEADER"},
  "visibility": "public_header|private_header|system_header|generated|unknown",
  "api_relevant": true,
  "confidence": "high|reduced|unknown"
}
```

### D5. Link TU dumps into a per-library source ABI surface

A source ABI linker merges per-TU facts into `source/source_abi.json` for
one binary/library.

Inputs:

- per-TU `SourceAbiTu` files;
- `BuildEvidence` target/link-unit mapping (ADR-029);
- the public header set;
- exported binary symbols from L0;
- optional version script/export map/`.def` file;
- ADR-024 public-surface provenance and reachability model.

Output:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "library": "build/libfoo.so",
  "target_id": "target://libfoo",
  "roots": {
    "exported_symbols": [],
    "public_header_declarations": [],
    "forced_public": []
  },
  "reachable_source_surface": {
    "declarations": [],
    "types": [],
    "macros": [],
    "templates": [],
    "inline_bodies": []
  },
  "mappings": {
    "source_decl_to_binary_symbol": [],
    "source_type_to_debug_type": [],
    "public_header_to_target": []
  },
  "odr_conflicts": [],
  "unmatched": [],
  "coverage": {}
}
```

### D6. Source replay findings

Comparison of two linked source ABI surfaces can produce source/API
findings. Proposed `ChangeKind` entries, each in exactly one partition set
(ADR-011); the resulting verdict follows the existing five-tier system
(ADR-009):

| Proposed kind | Partition | Artifact support needed? | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `public_macro_value_changed` | `API_BREAK_KINDS` | No | `FOO_SIZE` changed in a public header |
| `default_argument_changed` | `API_BREAK_KINDS` | No | `void f(int x = 1)` → `x = 2` (already detectable with headers today; replay adds build-context provenance) |
| `inline_body_changed` | `RISK_KINDS` | No | Inline public function body changed but no binary symbol changed |
| `constexpr_value_changed` | `API_BREAK_KINDS` | No | Public `constexpr int` value changed |
| `template_body_changed` | `RISK_KINDS` | No | Uninstantiated public template implementation changed (the ADR-026 `case122` residual) |
| `uninstantiated_template_removed` | `API_BREAK_KINDS` | No | Public template removed without any binary presence |
| `source_decl_binary_symbol_mismatch` | `RISK_KINDS` | Yes, for escalation | Public declaration no longer maps to an exported symbol |
| `odr_source_conflict` | `RISK_KINDS` | No | Same type name differs across TUs |
| `generated_header_changed` | `RISK_KINDS` (policy may escalate to API break) | No | Generated public config header changed |

Policy profiles (ADR-010) decide whether source-only findings block a
release. The defaults above keep them clearly distinguished from
artifact-proven `BREAKING` ABI changes.

### D7. Scope source replay aggressively for performance

| Mode | Behavior | Intended use |
|---|---|---|
| `off` | No source ABI replay | Default for existing users |
| `headers-only` | Replay public headers using matched TU context | Fast API/source coverage |
| `changed` | Replay changed public headers and the TUs owning changed headers/sources | PR mode (ADR-025 changed-path signal) |
| `target` | Replay all TUs contributing to the selected library target | Baseline mode |
| `full` | Replay all compile units in the build evidence | Nightly/deep mode |

The MVP implements `headers-only` and `changed`; `target` and `full`
follow.

### D8. Cache per-TU source ABI dumps

Cache key:

```text
hash(
  extractor name/version,
  source file content hash,
  transitive included public/private/generated header hashes,
  normalized compile context hash,
  public header root set,
  language standard / target / sysroot,
  abicheck source schema version
)
```

Cache values are per-TU dumps. Source ABI linking is cheap compared with
parsing and can be recomputed. Cache invalidation must prefer false misses
over false hits (ADR-033 D5).

### D9. No hard dependency on Android `.sdump`/`.lsdump`

Android's tools are useful, but their intermediate formats are documented
as implementation details. abicheck may provide an adapter:

```bash
abicheck collect-evidence --source-abi-extractor android-header-abi --output evidence/
```

The adapter must normalize into `SourceAbiTu` and `source_abi.json`. Raw
`.sdump`/`.lsdump` files may be preserved under `raw/android-header-abi/`.

### D10. Source-only evidence boundaries stay explicit

Every source-only finding carries:

```json
{
  "evidence_tier": "L4_SOURCE_ABI",
  "artifact_backing": "none|symbol_match|debug_type_match|header_ast_match",
  "verdict_authority": "source_api|artifact_abi|policy_escalated",
  "confidence": "high|reduced|unknown"
}
```

This prevents confusion between a shipped binary ABI break and a source/API
compatibility risk, and feeds the evidence coverage report (ADR-028 D7).

## Consequences

### Positive

- Covers the residual source/API space acknowledged by ADR-026 without
  replacing artifact comparison.
- Reuses real build context, avoiding false positives from parsing headers
  under the wrong flags.
- Enables comparison of source ABI surfaces, not just binary snapshots.
- Improves explanations for binary findings through source-to-symbol
  mappings.
- Gives projects an optional deeper mode for nightly and release baselines.

### Negative / risks

- C++ template and macro modeling is complex and frontend-dependent.
- Parsing many TUs is expensive without caching and scoping (D7, D8).
- Clang-based replay may not exactly match GCC/MSVC parsing of vendor
  extensions.
- Source-only findings can be noisy unless policy separates API breaks from
  ABI breaks (D6, D10).
- Generated headers must already exist (or be generated explicitly);
  otherwise replay coverage is partial and must be reported as such.

## Implementation plan

| Phase | Scope | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Define `SourceAbiTu` and `source_abi.json` schemas | Schema and empty-source coverage report |
| 2 | castxml/header replay adapter with `BuildEvidence` contexts | Public declaration/macro/default-arg coverage where available |
| 3 | Source ABI linker over public headers + exported symbols | Linked source surface per library |
| 4 | Source ABI diff findings (D6) | Source/API findings with authority labels |
| 5 | Clang LibTooling source dumper prototype | Inline/template/constexpr/body fingerprints |
| 6 | Optional Android header checker adapter | External tool reuse, raw artifact preservation |
| 7 | PR changed-mode and cache optimization | CI-ready source replay |

---

## Validation

- Fixture corpus for public macro / default argument / inline / template /
  constexpr changes (extending the ADR-026 `case122` calibration fixture).
- Compare source ABI replay against the existing L2 castxml snapshot for
  declarations and type shapes — they must agree where both have coverage.
- Cross-check exported source functions against L0 exported symbols.
- Deliberate source-only fixtures must produce `API_BREAK` /
  `COMPATIBLE_WITH_RISK` verdicts, never binary `BREAKING`, unless policy
  escalates.
- Performance tests for `changed` and `target` modes.
