# ADR-013: Suppression System Design

**Date:** 2026-03-18
**Status:** Accepted
**Decision maker:** Nikolay Petrov

---

## Context

Real-world ABI analysis produces findings that are technically correct but
operationally irrelevant: internal symbols exposed by visibility leaks,
deprecated APIs intentionally removed, known-safe type changes. Users need a
mechanism to suppress specific findings without disabling entire detectors.

### Requirements

- Suppress by symbol name (exact or pattern)
- Suppress by type name (for type-level changes only)
- Suppress by change kind
- Support temporary suppressions (expiry dates)
- Maintain an audit trail of suppressed changes
- Support ABICC skip/whitelist format for migration (Goal 1)
- Resist regex-based denial of service (ReDoS)

### Options considered

| Option | Description | Trade-off |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| A: JSON suppression files | Structured, schema-validated | Verbose for humans |
| **B: YAML suppression files** | Human-readable, concise | YAML parsing pitfalls (Norway problem, anchors) |
| C: Inline comments in source | Co-located with code | Requires source access; doesn't work for binary-only analysis |

## Decision

### YAML format

```yaml
suppressions:
  - symbol: _ZN3foo3barEv
    reason: "Internal API — not part of public contract"

  - symbol_pattern: "_ZN3foo.*Internal.*"
    change_kind: func_removed
    reason: "Entire internal namespace being cleaned up"
    expires: "2026-06-01"

  - type_pattern: ".*_internal_t"
    reason: "Internal types — layout changes are expected"

  - source_location: "include/internal/*.h"
    reason: "All changes in internal headers are suppressed"
    label: "internal"
```

YAML was chosen over JSON for human readability. PyYAML is already a
dependency (used for policy files). The `defusedxml` security approach is
applied to YAML: `yaml.safe_load()` only — no arbitrary Python object
construction.

### Suppression rule model

```python
@dataclass
class SuppressionRule:
    symbol: str | None           # Exact symbol match
    symbol_pattern: str | None   # Regex (fullmatch semantics)
    type_pattern: str | None     # Regex for type-level changes only
    change_kind: str | None      # Filter by ChangeKind value
    reason: str | None           # Documentation
    label: str | None            # Grouping tag (e.g., "workaround")
    source_location: str | None  # fnmatch glob against source path
    expires: date | None         # ISO 8601 date — inactive after expiry
```

### Matching semantics

**Selector exclusivity**: Exactly one of `symbol`, `symbol_pattern`,
`type_pattern`, or `source_location` must be specified per rule. This is
validated at load time — malformed rules produce immediate errors, not silent
no-ops.

**Fullmatch semantics**: Pattern matching uses `re.fullmatch()` — the pattern
must match the entire symbol name, not a substring. This prevents
over-suppression from partial matches.

**Type pattern scoping**: `type_pattern` only matches changes whose
`ChangeKind` is in the `_TYPE_CHANGE_KINDS` set. This prevents a type
whitelist from accidentally suppressing symbol-level changes on identically
named symbols.

**Source location matching**: `source_location` uses `fnmatch` glob syntax
(not regex). The match is against the file path portion of
`change.source_location` (strips `:line[:col]` suffix).

**Conjunctive matching**: When `change_kind` is specified alongside a selector,
both must match. The change kind narrows the selector — it does not act as an
independent filter.

### Regex safety

Python's `re` module is used with `re.compile()` for pattern compilation.
Patterns are compiled eagerly at rule load time — malformed patterns produce
immediate errors. Matching uses `fullmatch()` which applies the pattern to the
complete string.

While the documentation references RE2-style safety (guaranteed O(N)), the
implementation uses Python's standard `re` library. Complex patterns with
pathological backtracking are possible in theory but unlikely in practice for
symbol name patterns. For production deployments processing untrusted
suppression files, consider validating pattern complexity at load time.

### Expiry mechanism

```python
def is_expired(self, today: date | None = None) -> bool:
    if self.expires is None:
        return False
    return (today or date.today()) > self.expires
```

- Expired rules never match — they are silently skipped during filtering
- `expired_rules()` method returns a list of expired rules for warning
  generation
- YAML loader handles both ISO 8601 strings (`"2026-06-01"`) and native
  YAML date values
- `datetime` objects are converted to `date` to avoid `TypeError` in
  comparison

### Pipeline ordering

Suppression is applied at a specific point in the `compare()` pipeline:

```text
[30 detectors]
  → _deduplicate_ast_dwarf(changes)     # AST↔DWARF dedup
  → suppress.filter(changes)            # ← Suppression applied here
  → _filter_redundant(unsuppressed)     # Redundancy filtering (ADR-004)
  → _enrich_affected_symbols(kept)      # Symbol enrichment
  → compute_verdict(kept + redundant)   # Verdict on unsuppressed only
```

**Critical design choice**: Suppression runs before redundancy filtering.
This ensures that a suppressed change never contributes to the verdict —
whether it would have been classified as a root change or a redundant
derived change.

### Audit trail

Suppressed changes are preserved in `DiffResult.suppressed_changes`:

```python
@dataclass
class DiffResult:
    changes: list[Change]
    suppressed_changes: list[Change]  # filtered by suppression
    suppressed_count: int
```

Reports include a suppression summary section showing how many changes were
suppressed and which rules matched. This ensures suppressions are visible
and auditable.

### ABICC format support

For ABICC migration (ADR-012), the compat layer converts ABICC skip/whitelist
files to native `SuppressionRule` objects:

- `-skip-symbols` plain-text file → `SuppressionRule(symbol=...)` or
  `SuppressionRule(symbol_pattern=...)` depending on regex character detection
- `-skip-types` plain-text file → `SuppressionRule(symbol=..., change_kind=...)`
  scoped to type-level changes
- Unmangled C function names get an automatic Itanium mangling pattern
  fallback: `_Z\d+{name}.*`

### Validation

- Unknown keys in suppression entries are rejected (not silently ignored)
- `change_kind` values are validated against `_VALID_CHANGE_KINDS` frozenset
- Missing required selector (none of symbol/pattern/type_pattern/source_location)
  produces an error at load time

---

## Consequences

### Positive

- Fine-grained control over which findings appear in reports
- Expiry dates prevent stale suppressions from hiding real regressions
- Audit trail ensures suppressions are visible and reviewable
- ABICC skip file compatibility enables smooth migration
- Pipeline ordering guarantees suppressions affect verdicts correctly

### Negative

- YAML has well-known pitfalls (Norway problem, implicit type coercion) —
  mitigated by `safe_load()` and explicit validation
- Two suppression formats (YAML + ABICC text) adds maintenance burden
- `fullmatch` semantics may surprise users expecting substring matching
- Regex patterns in YAML require quoting to avoid YAML syntax conflicts
