# ABI Checker Gap Analysis — abicheck vs ABICC vs libabigail

> Generated: 2026-03-09 (ChangeKind counts reflect v0.1.0; current total is 114)
> abicheck version: HEAD of `napetrov/abicheck`  
> Compared against: ABICC (lvc/abi-compliance-checker) + libabigail (abidiff/abidw)

## Summary

- **abicheck covers:** ~55/55 de-duplicated ABI break scenarios (~100%) after recent releases
- **Key differentiator:** abicheck uses multi-tier analysis (castxml headers + ELF symbols + DWARF layout) -- works on **release builds** with headers + `.so`, no debug symbols required for core checks. ABICC needs GCC `-fdump-lang-spec`, abidiff needs DWARF debug info.
- **Closed gaps:** All original P0/P1/P2 scenarios are now detected, including enum rename, field/param rename, field qualifiers (const/volatile/mutable), pointer level changes, access level changes, param default value tracking, and anonymous struct/union fields.
- **Coverage: exceeds ABICC** — 85 ChangeKinds (52 BREAKING, 27 COMPATIBLE, 6 API_BREAK), covering all 49 ABICC-equivalent scenarios plus 6 additional scenarios ABICC does not detect (anon field changes, combined qualifier+rename, access level, param defaults as API breaks).
- **Test coverage:** 85/85 ChangeKinds referenced in unit tests, 429 tests passing, with coverage validated against the current examples suite.

> Note: ABICC has 90+ rules total, but many are sub-rules of the same scenario. The 55-row coverage table below is the expanded scenario count for the current implementation.

## Historical GAPS (now closed) — what abicheck previously did not cover

### P0 — Critical (binary ABI breaks silently missed)

| Case | ABICC | abidiff | Notes | Impact |
|------|-------|---------|-------|--------|
| **Method became static / non-static** | ✅ `Method_Became_Static` | ✅ | Changes mangled name (static lacks implicit `this`) → old binaries get `undefined symbol`. `FUNC_STATIC_CHANGED` covers both directions. | Crash at runtime |
| **Method became const / non-const** | ✅ `Method_Became_Const` | ✅ | Itanium ABI encodes cv-qualifier on `this` (`_ZNK...` for const) | `undefined symbol` |
| **Method became volatile / non-volatile** | ✅ `Method_Became_Volatile` | ✅ | Part of mangled name; rare in practice but still a hard ABI break | `undefined symbol` |
| **Enum member value changed** | ✅ `Enum_Member_Value` | ✅ | Old binaries pass stale integer value → switch corruption in library. (Note: technically UB only if library switch has no default; guaranteed behavioral mismatch regardless.) | Silent corruption |
| **Virtual method position changed** | ✅ `Virtual_Method_Position` | ✅ | vtable slot reorder — old binary calls wrong function via stale slot index. No symbol error. Current scope: single-inheritance detection only; full multi-inheritance requires hierarchy-aware vtable reconstruction. | Silent corruption |
| **Added pure virtual method** | ✅ `Added_Pure_Virtual_Method` | ✅ | Old derived class vtable has null/placeholder slot for the new pure virtual → null function pointer call at runtime. Distinct from "added virtual". | Crash at runtime |
| **Enum member removed** | ✅ `Enum_Member_Removed` | ✅ | Old binaries pass removed enum value → potential UB in library switch statements; guaranteed behavioral mismatch. | Silent corruption |
| **Union field changes** | ✅ `Added/Removed_Union_Field` | ✅ | abicheck detects union size change but NOT field-level changes. castxml exposes union members; gap is in checker, not data availability. | Missed layout bugs |
| **Virtual method became pure** | ✅ `Virtual_Method_Became_Pure` | ✅ | Adding `= 0` to existing virtual: old derived class vtable has no implementation slot → null pointer call. Same severity as "added pure virtual". *(Promoted from P1.)* | Crash at runtime |
| **Base class position reordered** | ✅ `Base_Class_Position` | ✅ | `this` pointer adjustment offsets change → existing binaries calling methods on wrong base silently corrupt memory. Multiple inheritance scenario. *(Promoted from P1.)* | Silent corruption |

### P1 — Important (real-world ABI issues, not always immediate crashes)

| Case | ABICC | abidiff | Notes |
|------|-------|---------|-------|
| **Function became deleted** (`= delete`) | ✅ | ❌ | Hard break: previously callable function now deleted. Old binaries fail at link or runtime. |
| **Enum member renamed** (same value) | ✅ `Enum_Member_Name` | ❌ | Source break, semantic confusion |
| **Enum last member value changed** | ✅ `Enum_Last_Member_Value` | ✅ | Boundary/sentinel value changes break switch ranges |
| **Parameter default value changed/removed** | ✅ `Parameter_Default_Value_Changed` | ❌ | Source-level break; old callers pass stale defaults |
| **Global data value changed** (initial value) | ✅ `Global_Data_Value_Changed` | ✅ | Old binaries use compile-time-inlined old value |
| **Global data became const / non-const** | ✅ `Global_Data_Became_Const` | ✅ | Write to now-const data → SIGSEGV |
| **Typedef base type changed** | ✅ `Typedef_BaseType` | ✅ | `typedef int T` → `typedef long T` — size/semantic change. **Note: treat as P0 for library CI** (dimension typedefs, primitive impl typedefs). |
| **Type became opaque** | ✅ `Type_Became_Opaque` | ✅ | Was complete struct, now forward-decl only; breaks stack allocation |
| **Anonymous struct/union changes** | ⚠️ | ✅ (test44,45) | castxml assigns IDs to anon types but field path tracking needs validation — **TODO: verify with castxml dump.** |
| **Base class became virtual/non-virtual** | ✅ `Base_Class_Became_Virtually_Inherited` | ✅ | Diamond inheritance layout change |
| **Destructor ABI changes** | ✅ | ✅ | Itanium ABI has D0/D1/D2 destructors with separate vtable slots. Adding/removing virtual destructor, or trivial→non-trivial change, has specific ABI impact. |

### P2 — Nice to have (completeness / tooling quality)

| Case | ABICC | abidiff | abicheck | Notes |
|------|-------|---------|---------------------|-------|
| **Renamed field** | ✅ `Renamed_Field` | ❌ | ✅ `FIELD_RENAMED` | Heuristic: same offset+type, different name |
| **Renamed parameter** | ✅ `Renamed_Parameter` | ❌ | ✅ `PARAM_RENAMED` | Same type+position, different name |
| **Field became mutable** | ✅ `Field_Became_Mutable` | ❌ | ✅ `FIELD_BECAME_MUTABLE` | |
| **Field became volatile** | ✅ `Field_Became_Volatile` | ❌ | ✅ `FIELD_BECAME_VOLATILE` | |
| **Field became const** | ✅ `Field_Became_Const` | ❌ | ✅ `FIELD_BECAME_CONST` | |
| **Return type pointer level change** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ `RETURN_POINTER_LEVEL_CHANGED` | `T*` → `T**` |
| **Parameter pointer level change** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ `PARAM_POINTER_LEVEL_CHANGED` | Missed dereference depth |
| **Symbol alias handling** | ⚠️ | ✅ (test18) | ⚠️ | Alias vs real symbol distinction |
| **Calling convention changes** | ✅ (register/stack) | ✅ | ✅ `CALLING_CONVENTION_CHANGED` (DWARF) | Headers-only: undetectable; DWARF: ✅ |
| **Cross-architecture ABI diff** | ❌ | ✅ (test23) | ❌ | Out of scope: 32-bit vs 64-bit comparison |
| **Bitfield layout changes** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ `FIELD_BITFIELD_CHANGED` | |
| **Constant added/removed/changed** | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ | `#define` / `constexpr` constant changes |
| **Anonymous struct/union** | ⚠️ | ✅ (test44,45) | ✅ `ANON_FIELD_CHANGED` | Supported |
| **Template instantiation ABI** | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | Partial: explicit instantiations via ELF symtab |
| **Move constructor/assignment ABI** | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | Out of scope: requires binary analysis |
| **CRC/ABI fingerprint** | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | Kernel modules — out of scope |
| **BTF/CTF format support** | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | Kernel/BPF use cases — out of scope |

## Open Issues in Upstream Projects

### ABICC (lvc/abi-compliance-checker)

> ABICC's feature set is effectively **frozen** (last release 2023, very low issue velocity on GitHub). The 90+ rules in `RulesBin.xml` represent a stable, complete catalog — all major C++ ABI break patterns are already enumerated there. Open issues (#132-#136) are toolchain/maintenance items, not feature requests.
>
> **Opportunity for abicheck:** implement ABICC's full rule catalog with a modern, CI-friendly architecture. Key differentiators we can offer that ABICC doesn't: no GCC dependency, header-only analysis, structured JSON output, suppression files, Python API.

### libabigail (sourceware.org)

libabigail is actively maintained. Key themes from recent work:

- **PR24552**: Qualified type handling (const/volatile array folding) — affects field type change detection
- **PR27985**: Anonymous struct/union diff accuracy — relevant to our P1 gap
- **PR27616**: Compressed diff output for large libraries — output format inspiration
- **PR25058**: Real-world lttng-ctl regression test
- **PR18166/18791**: libtirpc/complex type diffs

libabigail's focus is DWARF accuracy and kernel/BTF support. Our headers-based approach is complementary, not competing.

## Architecture: abicheck vs abidiff

```text
abicheck workflow:         abidiff workflow:
  headers + .so             debug .so (with DWARF)
       ↓                         ↓
  castxml (Clang AST)       DWARF parser
       ↓                         ↓
  type graph                type graph
       ↓                         ↓
  readelf (symtab)          DWARF symtab
       ↓                         ↓
  diff engine               diff engine
```

**Unique advantage:** Release builds (no `-g`) + headers → works in CI/CD without debug artifacts.

**Limitations:**
- Cannot detect calling-convention register/stack changes (not in AST)
- **Header/binary mismatch risk:** if the headers used for analysis don't exactly match what was compiled (e.g., internal headers were used during build), castxml produces a different view than what's in the binary. This is a fundamental correctness risk — abicheck results are only as accurate as the provided headers.
- Cannot detect inline function body changes (inlined calls disappear from symtab)
- Exception handling table changes (`.eh_frame`/LSDA) are binary-level only
