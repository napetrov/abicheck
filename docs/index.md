# abicheck

**abicheck** detects breaking changes in C/C++ shared libraries before they reach production. Point it at two builds of a library (plus their headers), and it tells you whether existing binaries will keep working or break at runtime.

It supports ELF (Linux), PE/COFF (Windows), and Mach-O (macOS) binaries, and it's a drop-in replacement for `abi-compliance-checker`.

> **Gate ABI in CI in 5 lines.** Drop the first-class
> [GitHub Action](user-guide/github-action.md) into any workflow — it installs
> everything, runs the comparison, sets the exit code, and can upload SARIF to
> the Security tab:
>
> ```yaml
> - uses: napetrov/abicheck@v0.3.0
>   with:
>     old-library: abi-baseline.json
>     new-library: build/libfoo.so
>     new-header: include/foo.h
> ```

## Why abicheck

- **Three-layer analysis** — ELF/PE/Mach-O symbol tables + Clang AST (via castxml) + DWARF/PDB cross-check. Each layer catches things the others miss.
- **216 detection rules** — symbol removal, signature changes, struct/class layout drift, vtable reordering, enum value shifts, qualifier changes, calling conventions, and many more. See the [Change Kind Reference](reference/change-kinds.md).
- **Multiple output formats** — Markdown, JSON, SARIF (GitHub Code Scanning), HTML.
- **Policy profiles** — `strict_abi`, `sdk_vendor`, `plugin_abi`, or custom YAML overrides.
- **ABICC drop-in** — full flag parity for migrating from `abi-compliance-checker`.
- **CI-ready** — clear exit codes, SARIF upload, snapshot-based baselines, first-class GitHub Action.
- **Agent-friendly** — structured JSON, Python API, and an [MCP server](user-guide/mcp-integration.md) for AI-driven workflows.
