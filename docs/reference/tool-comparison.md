# Benchmark & Tool Comparison

This document explains how each ABI checking tool works, what analysis method it uses,
benchmark results across real-world test cases, and why the numbers come out the way they do.

> **Note:** abicheck detects 100+ change types (see [Change Kind Reference](change-kinds.md)).
> The current cross-tool benchmark covers a pinned 74-case subset of the
> `examples/` catalog (`case01`-`case73` + `case26b`); the full catalog now has
> 121 cases. The subset is pinned so accuracy numbers stay reproducible across
> releases. A historical 42-case snapshot is kept below only for comparison with
> older reports.

> **Why the tools disagree.** The accuracy gaps below are mostly an *evidence*
> story: each tool sees a different subset of the binary/debug/header inputs. For
> the conceptual model — which evidence detects which change class — see
> [Evidence & Detectability](../concepts/evidence-and-detectability.md).

## How each tool analyses ABI

### abicheck (compare mode)

```
.so (v1) ──► ELF reader: exported symbols, SONAME, visibility
             castxml (Clang AST): types, methods, vtable, noexcept
             DWARF reader: size cross-check
          ──► snapshot (JSON)
                              ├──► checker engine ──► verdict
.so (v2) ──► (same) ──► snapshot (JSON) ┘
```

**Analysis basis:** ELF symbol table + Clang AST via castxml + DWARF.
**Header requirement:** Yes — headers are passed to castxml for full type analysis.
**Compiler requirement:** None — castxml runs separately as a standalone tool.

This gives abicheck three independent data sources per symbol: ELF (what is exported),
AST (what the C++ type contract says), and DWARF (actual compiled layout for cross-check).

---

### abicheck (compat mode)

Same analysis engine as `compare`, but accepts **ABICC-format XML descriptors**
instead of snapshots:

```xml
<descriptor>
  <version>1.0</version>
  <headers>/path/to/include/foo.h</headers>
  <libs>/path/to/libfoo.so</libs>
</descriptor>
```

Used as a drop-in for ABICC-based CI pipelines (`abicheck compat check -lib foo -old v1.xml -new v2.xml`).

**Why compat scores lower than compare mode:**
`compat` follows ABICC's verdict vocabulary: COMPATIBLE, BREAKING, NO_CHANGE.
It cannot represent the full `compare` verdict vocabulary cleanly in ABICC-style
pipelines, especially source-level-only breaks that are binary-safe (for example
an enum/member rename or reduced access level in a class method).
This is intentional and documented in `examples/ground_truth.json` as `expected_compat`.

**When to use `compat`:** When you have an existing ABICC XML pipeline and want to
migrate to abicheck without rewriting scripts.
**When to use `compare`:** For all new integrations — full verdict set including `API_BREAK`.

---

### abicheck (strict mode)

`compat` with `-s` / `--strict` flag. Promotes `COMPATIBLE` → `BREAKING` and
`API_BREAK` → `BREAKING`.

Two sub-modes via `--strict-mode`:
- `full` (default with `-s`): `COMPATIBLE` + `API_BREAK` → `BREAKING` (matches ABICC `-strict`)
- `api`: only `API_BREAK` → `BREAKING`, additive `COMPATIBLE` changes stay `COMPATIBLE`

**Why strict scores lower than compat mode:**
Several catalog cases are legitimately `COMPATIBLE` or `API_BREAK`. `--strict-mode full`
promotes these to `BREAKING` intentionally, just like ABICC `-strict`. These are correct
tool outputs for the strict policy, but score as misses against the ground truth.

**Why strict still has a full denominator:**
`abicheck strict` runs on all 74 cases in the benchmark subset. ABICC and abidiff runs can time out or error on
specific cases, so their scored denominators are lower in the benchmark matrix.

**When to use strict:** CI gates where any COMPATIBLE addition (e.g. new symbol) should
fail the build. Use `--strict-mode api` to avoid false positives on purely additive changes.

---

### abidiff (ELF mode, no headers)

```
.so (v1) ──► abidw ──► ABI XML ──┐
                                  ├──► abidiff ──► report
.so (v2) ──► abidw ──► ABI XML ──┘
```

**Analysis basis:** DWARF (primary), CTF/BTF fallback; pure ELF symbol table if no debug info present.
**Header requirement:** None (in ELF mode).
**Compiler requirement:** None.

abidiff reads type information from DWARF sections of the `.so` when available. If DWARF
is absent it falls back to CTF (Oracle/Solaris-style binaries) or BTF (Linux kernel/eBPF
modules), and finally to ELF symbol names only when no debug info is present.

For our benchmark, all `.so` files are built with `-g` so DWARF is used throughout.

**Current benchmark result:** see the 74-case benchmark-subset matrix below.
abidiff misses anything that is not directly a symbol removal or a change that DWARF
fully describes. Specifically:
- Struct layout, vtable, return type changes → DWARF often marks as COMPATIBLE because
  it cannot determine binary impact without header type context
- Enum value semantics, typedef chains → COMPATIBLE
- noexcept, static qualifier, const qualifier, access level → not in DWARF at all

> **Stripped binaries (no debug info):** abidiff degrades to ELF-only (symbol names).
> abicheck continues to work via castxml — header-based type analysis does not need
> debug symbols. This makes abicheck significantly more useful for production binaries.

---

### abidw + headers → abidiff

```
.so (v1) ──► abidw --headers-dir /path/to/headers/ ──► ABI XML ──┐
                                                                   ├──► abidiff ──► report
.so (v2) ──► abidw --headers-dir /path/to/headers/ ──► ABI XML ──┘
```

> Note: `--headers-dir` is a flag for **`abidw`** (the dumper), not `abidiff` itself.
> The filtering happens at dump time; `abidiff` only compares the resulting XML.

**`--headers-dir` role:** Filters which symbols are considered public API.
It does **not** provide additional type information — `abidw` still reads types from DWARF.

**Why abidiff+headers tracks abidiff in our suite:**
Our benchmark examples are compiled with `-fvisibility=default`, meaning all symbols
are exported by default. None of the headers use `__attribute__((visibility("hidden")))`.
So the header filter changes nothing — all symbols are already public in both modes.
The fundamental limitation is that abidiff relies on DWARF for types, not AST.
Even with perfect headers, it cannot see noexcept, static-qualifier changes, or
source-level-only changes that have no ELF/DWARF representation.

**When would `--headers-dir` help?** If the library uses `visibility("hidden")` for internal
symbols in the headers, `--headers-dir` would filter them out and reduce false positives.
It does not improve detection of semantic changes.

---

### ABICC (abi-dumper workflow)

```
.so (v1, compiled with -g) ──► abi-dumper ──► v1.abi ──┐
                                                         ├──► abi-compliance-checker ──► report
.so (v2, compiled with -g) ──► abi-dumper ──► v2.abi ──┘
```

**Analysis basis:** DWARF — same as abidiff, but through Perl-based abi-dumper.
**Header requirement:** Optional (pass `-public-headers` to filter to public API).
**Compiler requirement:** None. Debug build (`-g`) required.

**Current benchmark result:** see the 74-case benchmark-subset matrix below. The abi-dumper workflow
still times out or errors on specific C++ cases and can leave runaway
`abi-compliance-checker` child processes if the outer wrapper is interrupted.

---

### ABICC (XML / legacy mode)

```
v1.xml (headers dir + .so path) ──► abi-compliance-checker (invokes GCC internally) ──► report
v2.xml (headers dir + .so path) ──┘
```

**Analysis basis:** GCC-compiled AST from headers.
**Header requirement:** Yes — must point to headers directory.
**Compiler requirement:** Yes — **GCC only**. Clang and icpx are not supported.

**Why ABICC(xml) is slow and unreliable:**
1. **GCC invocation per case** — even for 5-line headers, GCC startup costs dominate
2. **Directory input causes redefinition errors** — if the descriptor's `<headers>` tag
   points to a directory, `abi-compliance-checker` includes ALL `.h` files found there,
   including duplicates from build subdirs → redefinition errors → wrong verdicts
3. **GCC compatibility** — `abi-compliance-checker` uses `gcc -fdump-lang-class` internally,
   whose output format changed between GCC major versions. ABICC 2.3 prints a compatibility
   warning on every run when used with GCC 11+. Results may differ across GCC versions.
4. **`case16_inline_to_non_inline`**: reliably hits 120s timeout

**Our fix in PR #72:** Pass a specific header file path instead of a directory in
`<headers>`. This drops runtime from 120s → ~1s and fixes wrong verdicts.

**Current benchmark result:** see the 74-case benchmark-subset matrix below.

## Verdict vocabulary comparison

| Verdict | abicheck compare | abicheck compat | abidiff | ABICC |
|---------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `NO_CHANGE` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (exit 0) | ⚠️ reports 100% compat |
| `COMPATIBLE` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (exit 4) | ⚠️ reports 100% compat |
| `API_BREAK` | ✅ | ❌ not supported | ❌ | ❌ |
| `BREAKING` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (exit 8+) | ✅ |

`API_BREAK` = source-level break, binary-compatible. Example: parameter renamed,
access level changed, pure API contract violation with no ABI binary change.
Only `abicheck compare` can emit this verdict.

---

## Why abicheck leads the matrix

abicheck uses three independent analysis passes per comparison:

1. **ELF pass** — symbol table diff: detects visibility changes, SONAME, symbol binding,
   symbol version policy, added/removed/renamed exported symbols
2. **castxml pass** — Clang AST diff: detects noexcept, static qualifier, const qualifier,
   method-became-static, pure virtual additions, access level, parameter/return type changes
   that are invisible in ELF/DWARF
3. **DWARF cross-check** — validates actual compiled type sizes, struct/class member offsets,
   vtable slot offsets, base class offsets, and `#pragma pack` / `-march`-sensitive alignment
   that header analysis alone may compute incorrectly

Neither abidiff nor ABICC runs all three passes. abidiff has no AST (misses noexcept, static,
const). ABICC has no ELF pass (misses SONAME, visibility). ABICC(dump) has no AST
(same gaps as abidiff plus instability on complex C++).

---

## Benchmarking by evidence tier

The cross-tool matrix above answers *"how does abicheck compare to other tools
when each is given its best input?"* A second, orthogonal benchmark answers
*"how much of the catalog can be discovered from each **source of information**?"*
— i.e. how detection grows as you feed abicheck more of the
[five sources](../concepts/evidence-and-detectability.md#0-the-five-sources-of-information).

This is run with a dedicated mode that scans every case at progressively richer
evidence levels:

```bash
python3 scripts/benchmark_comparison.py --evidence-tiers
# restrict to specific cases/suite as usual:
python3 scripts/benchmark_comparison.py --evidence-tiers --cases case01 case07 case34
```

> This is the **slow path**: it builds each case once and then runs the full
> `dump`+`compare` pipeline up to four times per case (one per tier), so scope it
> with `--cases`/`--suite` for quick iteration.

For each case it builds the libraries once, then runs the full `dump`+`compare`
pipeline four times:

| Tier | abicheck input | `--show-data-sources` mode | Active detectors |
|:----:|----------------|----------------------------|:----------------:|
| **L0** binary only | stripped `.so`, no `-H` | Symbols-only | ≈ 6 / 30 |
| **L1** + debug info | `-g` `.so`, no `-H` | DWARF-only | ≈ 24 / 30 |
| **L2** + public headers | `-g` `.so`, `-H include/` | Full (AST + DWARF) | 30 / 30 |
| **L3** + build context | L2 plus `-p build/` (when a compile DB exists) | Full + build evidence | 30 / 30 + L3 |

> **L4 (source ABI replay)** needs an EvidencePack from `collect-evidence`, which
> is not yet a packaged CLI command, so the tiered benchmark reports L4 as `n/a`.
> The one catalog case that *only* L4 could see
> ([case122](../examples/case122_template_signature_uninstantiated.md), an
> uninstantiated-template change) is a documented gap whose correct verdict is
> `NO_CHANGE` anyway.

### Which source discovers what

Each case in [`examples/ground_truth.json`](https://github.com/napetrov/abicheck/blob/main/examples/ground_truth.json)
carries a `min_evidence` field — the weakest source at which abicheck reaches the
correct verdict — derived by
[`scripts/evidence_tiers.py`](https://github.com/napetrov/abicheck/blob/main/scripts/evidence_tiers.py)
and validated by `tests/test_evidence_tiers.py`. Aggregated over the 126-case
catalog, that yields the cumulative coverage the `--evidence-tiers` summary
prints:

| Source provided | Layer | Cases first detectable here | Cumulative | Representative cases |
|-----------------|:-----:|:---------------------------:|:----------:|----------------------|
| Just the binary | L0 | 40 | **40 / 126 (32%)** | symbol removal ([01](../examples/case01_symbol_removal.md)), SONAME ([05](../examples/case05_soname.md)), visibility ([06](../examples/case06_visibility.md)), symbol-version removed ([65](../examples/case65_symbol_version_removed.md)), all 5 bundle cases |
| + Debug symbols | L1 | 62 | **102 / 126 (81%)** | struct layout ([07](../examples/case07_struct_layout.md)), enum value ([08](../examples/case08_enum_value_change.md)), vtable ([09](../examples/case09_cpp_vtable.md)), calling convention ([64](../examples/case64_calling_convention_changed.md)), bitfield ([63](../examples/case63_bitfield_changed.md)), toolchain flag drift ([103](../examples/case103_toolchain_flag_drift.md)) |
| + Public headers | L2 | 23 | **125 / 126 (99%)** | access level ([34](../examples/case34_access_level.md)), default arg removed ([123](../examples/case123_default_argument_removed.md)), class `final` ([125](../examples/case125_class_became_final.md)), `detail::` leaks ([74](../examples/case74_detail_base_class_changed.md)–[77](../examples/case77_detail_templated_base_changed.md)), scoped-internal *no-change* ([118](../examples/case118_internal_struct_field_added_scoped.md)–[120](../examples/case120_internal_struct_reordered_scoped.md)) |
| + Build data | L3 | 0 | **125 / 126 (99%)** | *(no catalog case requires L3 alone yet — see note)* |
| + Sources | L4 | 1 | **126 / 126 (100%)** | uninstantiated template ([122](../examples/case122_template_signature_uninstantiated.md), documented gap) |

> **Why L3 adds 0 here.** Build-flag drift *is* an L3 concern, but compilers
> record their flags redundantly in debug info (`DW_AT_producer` /
> `.GCC.command.line`), so the catalog's flag-drift case
> ([103](../examples/case103_toolchain_flag_drift.md)) is already discoverable at
> **L1** from a `-g` build — the `--evidence-tiers` run confirms it emits
> `toolchain_flag_drift` at L1. A compile database (L3) becomes *necessary* only
> when debug info is stripped, or for the broader build-evidence kinds
> (`abi_relevant_build_flag_changed`, `link_export_policy_changed`) that aren't
> recorded in any artifact — none of which is represented as a standalone catalog
> case yet.
>
> **Crediting rule.** A tier only counts as *discovering* a case when it emits
> the cataloged change **kind** with the right verdict, not merely a matching
> verdict — otherwise a weak tier that returns a bare `COMPATIBLE`/`NO_CHANGE`
> (the "found nothing" defaults) would be miscredited. Active `BREAKING`/`API_BREAK`
> verdicts are genuine findings, so a verdict match suffices there (and avoids
> penalising tier-appropriate variant kinds such as L0's `func_removed_elf_only`).

Two directions matter, not just one:

- **Discovery.** Most layout and source-only breaks are simply *invisible*
  without the right source — a struct-field insertion is `NO_CHANGE` at L0 and
  `BREAKING` only once L1 debug info is present.
- **False-positive suppression.** More evidence also *removes* spurious breaks:
  the scoped-internal cases ([118](../examples/case118_internal_struct_field_added_scoped.md)–[120](../examples/case120_internal_struct_reordered_scoped.md))
  change an internal struct that looks like a layout break at L1, and only L2
  header scoping lets abicheck correctly return `NO_CHANGE`.

> **Caveat.** The L2/L3 columns require `castxml` (and, for L3, a
> `compile_commands.json`) to be present in the benchmark environment; where a
> source is unavailable the runner records the tier as `n/a`/`ERROR` rather than
> a miss, so read the tiered numbers together with the
> [evidence-coverage](../concepts/evidence-pack.md#evidence-coverage) report for
> the run.

| abicheck compat | ~79s | XML descriptor mode |
| abidiff | ~2.5s | ELF+DWARF, very fast |
| ABICC (dumper) | ~294s | abi-dumper + abi-compliance-checker per case |
| ABICC (xml) | ~445s | GCC compilation per case; case09+case16 TIMEOUT |

> Measured on: Ubuntu 22.04, 8 vCPU, 32GB RAM. All runs sequential.

## Run the benchmark yourself

```bash
# Fresh benchmark for the current checkout
python3 scripts/benchmark_comparison.py --abicc-mode both
```

```bash
# Skip ABICC (CI-friendly, ~15s total)
python3 scripts/benchmark_comparison.py --skip-abicc
```

```bash
# Select specific cases or tools
python3 scripts/benchmark_comparison.py --cases case01 case09 case21
python3 scripts/benchmark_comparison.py --tools abicheck abidiff
```

## Choosing the right tool

| Scenario | Recommended |
|----------|-------------|
| New CI pipeline, full accuracy | `abicheck compare` |
| Migrating from ABICC XML pipeline | `abicheck compat check` |
| Strict gate (any addition = fail) | `abicheck compat check -s` |
| Debug build available, DWARF check | `abicheck compare` (castxml already better) |
| Quick ELF-only sanity check | `abidiff` (fast, 30% (22/73) but catches symbol removals) |
