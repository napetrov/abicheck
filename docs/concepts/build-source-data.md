# Source & Build Data

abicheck primarily compares **built artifacts** — binaries (L0), debug info
(L1), and public headers (L2). A **build/source pack** is an *optional* sidecar
that augments a snapshot with **source and build evidence** (ADR-028): build
context (L3), and — in later releases — source ABI replay (L4) and source
graph summaries (L5).

The pack exists to give the existing ABI/API decision engine **more facts** —
to reduce false positives, explain and localize breaks, and detect
source/API risks artifact comparison cannot see. It does **not** turn abicheck
into a general static analyzer.

## The authority rule (the one rule that matters)

> **Artifact-backed L0/L1/L2 evidence remains authoritative for shipped-ABI
> verdicts.** Source/build evidence (L3/L4/L5) may *explain, localize, scope,
> add confidence/provenance, or correlate* an artifact-proven break — but it
> **never silently deletes** one.

Findings produced *only* by build/source evidence are ordinary
[change kinds](../reference/change-kinds.md) that default to **`API_BREAK`**
(source-level breaks) or **risk** (deployment/context risk), never **breaking**
unless an artifact diff also proves the break. They flow through the normal
[verdict](verdicts.md) computation with worst-verdict-wins.

## Evidence layers

| Layer | Source | Purpose | Verdict authority |
|---|---|---|---|
| L0 | ELF/PE/Mach-O | Exported binary ABI facts | Authoritative |
| L1 | DWARF/PDB/BTF/CTF | Layout/type/calling-convention | Authoritative when matched to binary |
| L2 | castxml/public headers | Public API declarations | Authoritative for header-visible API |
| **L3** | compile DB, CMake, Ninja, Bazel, Make | Toolchain, flags, target graph, generated-file provenance | Context/confidence |
| **L4** | per-TU source ABI replay | Source-visible ABI/API facts | API/source-risk evidence; never sole shipped-ABI authority |
| **L5** | Clang/Kythe/CodeQL graph summaries | Include/type/call/build reasoning | Explanation, localization, impact |

L3 and L4 are implemented today (ADR-029, ADR-030). L4 ships three extractor
backends — **clang** (the source-based default: inline/template/constexpr body
fingerprints + default arguments), **castxml** (declarations/types/const values),
and an **Android** header-checker adapter — plus the linker, source-replay diff,
replay scopes, and per-TU cache (see [L4 findings](#source-abi-replay-findings-l4)).

L5 has landed (ADR-031, phases 1–4): a compact, abicheck-owned **source graph
summary**. Folded from the L3 build evidence it carries `target`,
`compile_unit`, `source`, `header`, `generated_file`, and `build_option` nodes
linked by `TARGET_HAS_SOURCE` / `TARGET_HAS_PUBLIC_HEADER` / `TARGET_DEPENDS_ON`
/ `COMPILE_UNIT_BUILDS_SOURCE` / `COMPILE_UNIT_USES_OPTION` edges. When an L4
source surface was also collected (`--source-abi`), it additionally folds in
`source_decl` / `record_type` / `enum_type` / `typedef` / `macro` nodes linked
to their declaring public header (`SOURCE_DECLARES`) and to their exported
binary symbol / debug type (`SOURCE_DECL_MAPS_TO_SYMBOL`,
`SOURCE_TYPE_MAPS_TO_DEBUG_TYPE`, `BINARY_EXPORTS_SYMBOL`) — giving the full
`target → public header → declaration → exported symbol` reachability closure.
Every node and edge carries provenance and a confidence label. Collect it with
`--source-graph summary` and compare two summaries with `compare-graph` (below).
Deeper layers extend the same graph: approximate Clang call edges
(`--call-graph`), compile-unit include edges (`--include-graph`), and
pre-captured Kythe/CodeQL backends (`--kythe-entries`/`--codeql-results`). All
six graph-derived findings flow through `compare-graph` and the verdict
pipeline, and `explain-finding` localizes a single finding through the graph.

> **Source ABI replay (L4) requires clang** (or castxml for the declaration
> subset, or a pre-captured Android dump). It is the one tier gated on a C++
> front-end. If the tool is missing, abicheck **fails gracefully**: L4 is marked
> partial, the source-only checks are reported as disabled, and the
> artifact-backed tiers (L0–L2) remain fully authoritative — the comparison is
> never aborted.

## How the data flows

Two independent producers feed one decision engine. The **artifact pipeline**
(always on, authoritative) turns each binary into an `AbiSnapshot`; the
**evidence pipeline** (optional, post-build, never rebuilds) collects an
out-of-band `build/source pack`. At `compare` time both are diffed and reconciled
under the [authority rule](#the-authority-rule-the-one-rule-that-matters):

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph artifact["Artifact pipeline — authoritative"]
      BIN["binary (.so/.dll/.dylib)"] --> P["format parser<br/>ELF / PE / Mach-O"]
      P --> L0["L0 binary metadata"]
      L0 --> L1["+ L1 DWARF/PDB/BTF/CTF"]

    SNAP --> CMP{{"compare"}}
    PACK -. "pass explicitly:<br/>--old/--new-build-info" .-> CMP

    DIFFE --> REC
    REC --> OUT["Verdict + evidence-coverage table + capability report"]
```

Three consequences fall out of this shape, all by design:

- The facts are **embedded in the snapshot**. `dump --build-info/--sources`
  folds the normalized build + source facts directly into the `.abi.json`, so a
  later `compare old.json new.json` carries them with **no out-of-band
  directories** (single-artifact UX). The pack directory that `collect`
  produces stays available as an explicit per-side override
  (`--old-build-info`/`--new-build-info`, `--old-sources`/`--new-sources`), and
  raw provenance is never embedded — only the normalized facts that feed the
  comparison.
- Collection is **post-build and read-only**: it reads existing build outputs and
  build-system query interfaces; it never rebuilds your project or runs arbitrary
  commands.
- The verdict is only as strong as the evidence behind it, so every
  build/source-aware run prints the `layer_coverage` table and the capability
  report below.

## Workflow

The default path is unchanged. Build/source data is **post-build and opt-in** —
it never rebuilds your project or runs arbitrary commands; it reads existing
build outputs and build-system query interfaces only.

### The source-tree-centric flow (recommended)

The common case is a **shipped binary** (e.g. a prebuilt package) plus a
**source checkout at the tag it was built from**. Point `dump` straight at the
source tree — `--sources <tree>` runs L4 source ABI replay **and** the L5 graph
internally and embeds them; there are no separate `--source-abi`/`--source-graph`
toggles, and the graph is always built (it is compact by design):

```bash
# Source ABI replay (L4) + graph (L5) inline from a checkout, plus L3 from a
# compile DB auto-discovered inside the tree (or pass --build-info explicitly):
abicheck dump libfoo.so -H include/ \
  --sources ./libfoo-src/ -o new.abi.json

# Compare — the embedded L3/L4/L5 facts diff automatically, no pack dirs:
abicheck compare old.abi.json new.abi.json
```

`--build-info <path>` is the optional, **decoupled** L3 input: a build dir, a
`compile_commands.json`, or a pre-captured pack. When omitted, a
`compile_commands.json` inside the source tree is auto-discovered; if there is
none, L3 is reported as `not_collected` and the scan continues. Source ABI
replay (L4) still **requires clang** (or castxml for the declaration subset) and
degrades to partial coverage when the front-end is absent — the artifact tiers
stay authoritative (ADR-028 D3).

### Parallel baselines with `merge`

Build-side and source-side facts can be produced independently — on different
machines, at different times — and combined into one self-contained baseline:

```bash
abicheck dump libfoo.so -H include/   -o libfoo.bin.json   # L0/L1/L2 (+optional L3)
abicheck dump --sources ./libfoo-src/ -o libfoo.src.json   # L3/L4/L5, no binary
abicheck merge libfoo.bin.json libfoo.src.json -o libfoo.baseline.json
```

`merge` keeps the binary-bearing snapshot's ABI surface and folds every input's
embedded `build_source` facts together per layer (each layer should come from
exactly one input), so the result is a single `.abi.json` carrying all of
L0–L5.

### Build-tool query configuration (`.abicheck.yml`)

A source checkout often *contains* the build system. abicheck can use it to
recover exact ABI-affecting flags and generated headers — gated by a per-project
config and the ADR-032 D5 action ceiling (**read by default, query opt-in, full
build never**):

```yaml
# .abicheck.yml at the source-tree root (or pass --build-config <path>)
build:
  system: bazel            # bazel | cmake | make | meson | auto (default: auto-detect)
  # A command that EMITS flags/exports without performing a full project build —
  # e.g. a configured-graph/action query, not `cmake --build` / `make all`.
  query: "bazel cquery 'deps(//cpp/oneapi/dal:core)' --output=jsonproto"
  compile_db: bazel-out/.../compile_commands.json   # where the flags land
sources:
  public_headers: ["cpp/oneapi/dal/**/*.hpp"]
  exclude: ["**/test/**", "**/backend/**"]
```

- **`inspect` (default, always on):** read existing build outputs / compile DBs
  the checkout already has. No config needed.
- **`query_build_system` (opt-in, `--allow-build-query`):** run the configured
  `build.query` command to emit flags/exports. abicheck runs it with no shell
  (parsed via `shlex`) in the source-tree directory.
- **`run_build` / `wrap_build` (denied):** abicheck never performs a full
  project build or compiler-wrapper interception.

### Advanced: `collect` and out-of-band packs

The `collect` command (which writes an on-disk pack directory) remains for
advanced use — raw-provenance retention, external CLI extractors (ADR-032 D3),
per-TU caching, and audit mode. The common workflow above never needs it. A
pack directory it produces can still be embedded (`dump --build-info <pack>` /
`--sources <pack>` auto-detect a pack by its `manifest.json`) or supplied
out-of-band per side at compare time:

```bash
# (Advanced) Override or supply facts out-of-band per side instead of embedding:
abicheck compare old.abi.json new.abi.json \
  --old-build-info old.bs/ --new-build-info new.bs/

# (Advanced) Collect a pack from an existing build tree (no rebuild), then embed:
abicheck collect \
  --compile-db build/compile_commands.json \
  --source-abi \
  --source-abi-extractor clang \          # clang (default) | castxml | android
  --source-abi-scope target \             # off | headers-only | changed | target | full
  --source-abi-cache .abicache/source \   # optional per-TU dump cache (ADR-030 D8)
  --source-graph summary \
  --output libfoo.evidence/
abicheck dump libfoo.so -H include/ --sources libfoo.evidence/ -o new.abi.json
```

- `--source-abi-scope changed --changed-path src/foo.cpp` replays only changed
  TUs (and TUs of any target whose public header changed) — PR mode.
- `--source-abi-extractor android --android-dump libfoo.lsdump` reuses a
  pre-captured Android `header-abi-dumper`/`header-abi-linker` dump instead of
  running a compiler.

Add `--call-graph` (requires `clang++`) to also fold approximate direct-call
edges (`DECL_CALLS_DECL`, each labelled with a `call_kind` and `resolution`
confidence) into the graph — enabling the
`call_graph_public_entry_reachability_changed` quality finding. Without `clang`
the graph is still collected, just without call edges.

Further graph layers (all optional, all non-aborting if the tool/file is
absent):

- `--include-graph` (requires `clang++`) folds compile-unit include edges
  (`COMPILE_UNIT_INCLUDES_FILE`, from `clang -MM`), enabling
  `include_graph_public_header_drift`.
- `--kythe-entries FILE` / `--codeql-results FILE` fold a **pre-captured**
  Kythe entries export or CodeQL call-graph query result into the graph
  (ADR-031 D5). abicheck never runs Kythe or CodeQL — it ingests their exported
  JSON and records the external store in `external_graph_refs`.

Localize a single finding through the graph:

```bash
abicheck explain-finding --sources libfoo.evidence/ --symbol _ZN3foo3barEv
# or resolve the symbol from a JSON report:
abicheck explain-finding --sources libfoo.evidence/ --report report.json --finding-id 0
```

It reports what produced and reaches the symbol — exporting target, source
declaration(s), declaring public header(s), ABI-relevant build option(s), and
static callees — as graph-derived explanation, never an ABI verdict.

Compare two graph summaries directly — pass either the pack directories or the
`graph/source_graph_summary.json` files:

```bash
abicheck compare-graph old.evidence/ new.evidence/            # structural delta
abicheck compare-graph old.evidence/ new.evidence/ --format json
```

The diff is **structural** (which nodes/edges entered or left the graph). Per
the authority rule it explains and prioritizes impact; it never, on its own,
decides or suppresses an artifact-proven ABI break.

`collect` accepts:

- `--compile-db PATH` / `-p DIR` — a `compile_commands.json` (the universal,
  low-friction input).
- `--build-dir DIR --cmake` — the CMake File API *reply* directory (target
  graph, public/private header file sets, toolchains).
- `--build-dir DIR --ninja` / `--ninja-compdb FILE` — Ninja `-t compdb`/`graph`
  output (live query or pre-captured for hermetic CI).
- `--bazel-cquery FILE` / `--bazel-aquery FILE` — pre-captured
  `bazel cquery --output=jsonproto` (configured target graph) and
  `bazel aquery --output=jsonproto` (compile/link action graph). Use the
  textual `jsonproto` form: a binary `--output=proto` blob is reported with a
  diagnostic rather than decoded (binary-proto ingestion is a documented
  follow-up).
- `--make-dry-run FILE` — a pre-captured `make -n`/`make --trace` transcript.
  Make has no authoritative target graph, so the recovered compile units are
  **reduced confidence**; prefer a generated `compile_commands.json` when one
  is available.
- `--read-compiler-record` (with `--binary`) — recover compiler provenance from
  the built binary itself: the `.GCC.command.line` ELF section
  (`-frecord-gcc-switches` / `-frecord-command-line`) and DWARF
  `DW_AT_producer`. These signals are **advisory** unless cross-checked against
  build-system evidence.

### Worked example: a CMake library, end to end

Two releases of `libfoo`, each built with CMake. The goal is a full
**L0+L1+L2+L3(+L4)** compare so a build-flag change or a source-only API change
is caught alongside the binary diff.

```bash
# --- For EACH release (old and new), at build time ---
# 1. Build with -g and export the compile database (one extra CMake flag).
cmake -S libfoo-1.0 -B build-old -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
      -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
cmake --build build-old

# 2. Collect the build/source pack from the existing build tree (no rebuild).
#    Add --source-abi for L4 (needs clang); drop it for L3-only.
abicheck collect \
    --compile-db build-old/compile_commands.json \
    --build-dir build-old --cmake \
    --source-abi \
    --output libfoo-1.0.evidence/

# 3. Snapshot the built library WITH headers and the build context.
#    -p bakes the L3 build flags into how the headers are parsed, and records
#    parsed_with_build_context so the later compare won't flag header drift.
abicheck dump build-old/libfoo.so -H libfoo-1.0/include -p build-old \
    --version 1.0 -o libfoo-1.0.abi.json

# (repeat steps 1-3 for the new release → libfoo-2.0.abi.json + libfoo-2.0.evidence/)

# --- At compare time (CI), pass BOTH snapshots AND both packs ---
abicheck compare libfoo-1.0.abi.json libfoo-2.0.abi.json \
    --old-build-info libfoo-1.0.evidence/ \
    --new-build-info libfoo-2.0.evidence/
```

The compare prints the [coverage table and capability report](#evidence-coverage)
first, so you can confirm every layer landed before trusting the verdict — if a
row says `not_collected` or `[off]`, that is exactly the input or tool to add.

Because `dump --build-info/--sources` embeds the normalized facts into the
`.abi.json`, a normal `compare old.json new.json` carries the L3/L4/L5 findings
with **no out-of-band directories**. Keeping the `*.evidence/` pack directories
next to the snapshots (e.g. as CI artifacts) is therefore optional — useful only
when you want to re-attach raw provenance, override a side at compare time with
`--old/--new-build-info` / `--old/--new-sources`, or debug what was collected.

## External CLI extractors & the security model (ADR-032)

A build system abicheck does not natively support can be integrated through an
**external CLI extractor** — a separate program registered by a YAML manifest,
talked to over a subprocess boundary with declared inputs, outputs, and actions.
No untrusted Python is ever imported into the abicheck process.

```yaml
# my-extractor.yaml
name: abicheck-cmake-extractor
version: "1.0"
capabilities: { compile_db: true, target_graph: true }
allowed_actions: [inspect, query_build_system]
commands:
  collect:   ["abicheck-cmake-extractor", "collect", "--output", "{raw_dir}"]
  normalize: ["abicheck-cmake-extractor", "normalize", "--raw", "{raw_dir}", "--out", "{normalized_dir}"]
outputs:
  normalized:
    - { kind: build_evidence, path: build/build_evidence.json }
```

```bash
abicheck collect \
  --extractor-manifest my-extractor.yaml \
  --allow-build-query \
  -o libfoo.evidence/
```

The security model has three pillars:

- **Trusted-by-operator, never auto-discovered.** A manifest runs only when you
  register it explicitly with `--extractor-manifest PATH`. abicheck never scans
  `PATH`, the working tree, or any plugin directory.
- **Declared actions are a ceiling, not a grant.** `inspect` (read existing
  files) is the only action allowed by default. `query_build_system` is enabled
  by `--allow-build-query`; `run_compiler`, `run_build`, `wrap_build`, and
  `network` are denied by default (network always). A manifest's
  `allowed_actions` are *intersected* with what the run permits, so a manifest
  can never escalate beyond what you turned on — and an extractor that needs an
  action you did not enable is **skipped** with a diagnostic, never run.
- **No shell, sanitized environment.** Commands are an argv list (never a shell
  string) run with `shell=False` and a minimal environment, so a third-party
  tool never receives your full environment (which may hold tokens). Note the
  action model gates *invocation* — abicheck refuses to launch an extractor that
  needs a disallowed action — but it does not sandbox a process once launched;
  `network` being denied means no extractor that *declares* it is run, not a
  kernel-level block. This is why manifests are trusted-by-operator: register
  only extractors you vet.

Every external run records a full **reproducibility ledger** row in the pack
manifest (ADR-032 D10): the redacted command, its content hash, declared
capabilities, start/finish timestamps, status, and diagnostics.

`--collection-mode` controls how failures are handled (ADR-032 D9):

- `permissive` (default) — a failed extractor degrades coverage; collection
  continues. Good for PR CI.
- `strict` — a failed or invalid extractor exits non-zero. Good for baseline
  generation, where missing evidence must be a hard error.
- `audit` — preserve raw artifacts and full diagnostics for debugging.

## Build-evidence findings (L3)

When two packs are compared, abicheck diffs their normalized build evidence and
emits these change kinds (ADR-029 D9):

| Kind | Category | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `build_context_changed` | compatible (quality) | Non-ABI build metadata changed |
| `abi_relevant_build_flag_changed` | risk | An ABI-affecting flag changed (`-std`, `_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI`, `-fvisibility`, `-fpack-struct`, `-fabi-version`, …) |
| `header_parse_context_drift` | risk | Headers were parsed under a different context than the real build |
| `toolchain_version_changed` | risk | Compiler/stdlib/sysroot changed |
| `generated_file_dependency_unstable` | risk | Build graph indicates generated-file dependency risk |
| `link_export_policy_changed` | risk | Version script / export map / `.def` file changed |

None of these escalate to *breaking* on their own. When an export-policy change
actually removes exported symbols, the artifact diff (L0) emits the breaking
`symbol_removed` finding separately; `link_export_policy_changed` explains and
localizes it.

## Source ABI replay findings (L4)

Some API/ABI-relevant facts are weakly represented or absent in final
binary/debug artifacts — macro constants, default arguments, inline/template
bodies, `constexpr` values, and uninstantiated templates. ADR-030 adds an
**optional** source ABI replay layer that parses selected translation units and
public headers under their real per-TU build context (from L3) and links the
result against the library's exported surface (`source/source_abi.json`).

Comparing two linked source surfaces emits these change kinds (ADR-030 D6):

| Kind | Category | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `public_macro_value_changed` | API break | A macro constant in a public header changed value |
| `default_argument_changed` | API break | A default argument changed (signature unchanged) |
| `constexpr_value_changed` | API break | A public `constexpr` constant changed value |
| `uninstantiated_template_removed` | API break | A public template was removed without any binary presence |
| `public_typedef_target_changed` | API break | A public typedef/alias now resolves to a different underlying type (clang backend) |
| `inline_body_changed` | risk | A public inline body changed with no exported-symbol change (mixed-build/ODR risk) |
| `template_body_changed` | risk | An uninstantiated public template implementation changed (the ADR-026 `case122` residual) |
| `source_decl_binary_symbol_mismatch` | risk | A public declaration no longer maps to an exported symbol |
| `odr_source_conflict` | risk | The same type name resolves to different definitions across TUs |
| `generated_header_changed` | risk | A generated public configuration header changed (policy may escalate) |

Per the authority rule, **none of these are `breaking` on their own**: they are
source/API findings (`API_BREAK`) or deployment/context risks. Every L4 finding
carries an explicit `L4_SOURCE_ABI` evidence-tier boundary (ADR-030 D10) so a
source/API risk is never read as a proven shipped-binary ABI break. A shipped
binary ABI break is still proven only by the artifact diff (L0/L1/L2), and
policy profiles decide whether a source-only finding blocks a release.

## Source graph findings (L5)

When both packs carry an L5 source graph summary, comparing them (via `compare`
with `--old/--new-build-info`, or directly with `compare-graph`) produces
graph-derived **risk** findings (ADR-031 D6):

| ChangeKind | verdict | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `public_reachability_changed` | risk | A declaration entered or left the public-API reachability closure (target → public header → declaration → exported symbol) |
| `source_to_binary_mapping_changed` | risk | A declaration present in both versions now maps to a different exported binary symbol |
| `generated_header_reaches_public_api` | risk | A generated file newly participates in the public declaration closure (it is a public header) |
| `call_graph_public_entry_reachability_changed` | compatible (quality) | The implementation statically reachable from an exported entry point changed (approximate Clang call graph; needs `--call-graph`) |
| `include_graph_public_header_drift` | risk | A public header entered/left the compiled include graph (needs `--include-graph`) |
| `build_option_reaches_public_symbol` | risk | A changed ABI-relevant build option feeds a compile unit producing an exported symbol |

These **explain and prioritize** impact; like the L4 findings they are never
`breaking` on their own. Each carries the `L5_SOURCE_GRAPH` evidence-tier
boundary, and per ADR-028 D3 they never override or suppress an artifact-proven
ABI break.

## Evidence coverage

Every compare run that involves a pack prints an **evidence-coverage table** so
you can tell which findings are artifact-proven vs. build-context-only:

```text
Evidence coverage:
  L0 binary metadata         present, high confidence
  L1 debug info              present, high confidence: DWARF
  L2 public header AST       present, high confidence: header-scoped
  L3 build context           present, high confidence: cmake+ninja, 142 compile units, 1 target
  L4 source ABI replay       present, high confidence: clang extractor, scope=target, parsed 142/142 TUs
  L5 source graph summary    not_collected
```

The same rows are emitted as a structured `layer_coverage` array in the
`--format json` report (schema `report_schema_version` 2.0+; the key was
`evidence_coverage` in 1.x), so machine consumers can key off layer status
and confidence.

### Evidence metrics (timing & finding split)

Alongside the coverage table, a pack-aware compare prints an **evidence-metrics
summary** (ADR-033 D6/D9) so CI can tune which evidence mode to run by cost and
signal:

```text
Evidence metrics:
  collection time            0.0142s
  findings                   artifact-backed=3, source-only=0, build-context-drift=1
```

The same numbers are emitted as a structured `evidence_metrics` object in the
`--format json` report, keyed by the D9 metric names:

```json
"evidence_metrics": {
  "extractor.duration_seconds": 0.0142,
  "coverage.build_context.present": true,
  "coverage.source_abi.mode": "not_collected",
  "coverage.graph.mode": "not_collected",
  "findings.artifact_backed.count": 3,
  "findings.source_only.count": 0,
  "findings.build_context_drift.count": 1,
  "findings.demoted_by_surface.count": 0,
  "findings.suppressed_with_reason.count": 0
}
```

`artifact-backed` findings are proven by the binary/debug/header tiers (L0–L2);
`source-only` and `build-context-drift` come from the optional L3–L5 layers and
never override an artifact-backed verdict. Both blocks are additive and present
only when build-info/source facts were involved in the compare.

### What is being checked — and what is not, and why

Right below the coverage table, every pack-aware compare prints a **capability
report** that translates the available evidence into the concrete *check
categories* it enables — and, for each disabled category, the precise reason.
This makes the cumulative picture explicit as you add inputs (binary → +debug
info → +headers → +build data → +sources):

```text
Checks enabled for this scan (and why others are not):
  [on]  Symbol presence & linkage (added/removed/SONAME) — from the binary's dynamic symbol table
  [on]  Type layout, members, vtables, signatures — from DWARF/PDB debug info
  [on]  API decls absent from the symbol table; public-surface scoping — from the public header AST
  [on]  Build-flag & toolchain drift (visibility, std, ABI flags) — from build-system data
  [off] Macros, default args, inline/template/constexpr bodies — no sources/clang: source-only API changes are not detected
  [off] Impact / call / reachability graph — no graph evidence: cross-symbol impact is not analyzed
```

Each category is gated on exactly one evidence layer, so a `[off]` line tells you
exactly which input (or tool) to add to enable it — e.g. installing clang and
passing `--source-abi` turns on the macro / default-argument / inline-body /
template-body / constexpr checks.

### Header parse context

`header_parse_context_drift` fires when the new side carries a public-header AST
that was **not** parsed with the build's ABI-relevant flags. To avoid this,
dump the snapshot with the build's compile database — `abicheck dump … -p build/`
records `parsed_with_build_context` on the snapshot, and a later `compare`
honors it and suppresses the drift finding.

## Schema & storage

- The pack is **content-addressed** and **versioned independently**
  (`evidence_pack_version`) from the ABI snapshot schema, so it never bloats an
  ordinary dump. The snapshot stores only a lightweight `evidence_pack`
  reference (content hash + coverage summary); old readers ignore it.
- Every extractor writes both a **raw** artifact (under `raw/`, for
  provenance/debugging) and an abicheck-owned **normalized** fact model (e.g.
  `build/build_evidence.json`). Only normalized facts feed comparison and the
  content hash.
- Command lines and paths are **redacted** (home prefixes, secret-looking
  `-D` macros) before they are persisted.
