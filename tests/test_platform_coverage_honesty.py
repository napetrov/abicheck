"""Cross-platform honesty guard.

Linux/ELF is the CI-validated baseline; macOS and Windows are parser-level and
only partially exercised end-to-end (see docs/reference/platforms.md and
docs/development/usecase-coverage-evaluation.md, gap G1). These tests keep the
``examples/ground_truth.json`` ``platforms`` tags honest about that hierarchy so
a future case cannot silently claim e.g. Windows-only support that CI never
runs.
