"""Tracked use-case for the *versioned-symbol naming scheme* pattern (field-eval P08).

Libraries like **ICU** embed the major version in *every* exported symbol name
(``u_strlen_75`` → ``u_strlen_78``). A routine, source-compatible upgrade then
reads as a wall of `func_removed` + `func_added` — 16 k changes for ICU 75→78 in
the field evaluation — even though almost nothing about the API actually changed.
OpenSSL/LLVM hit the same shape via GNU symbol-version nodes
(`symbol_moved_version_node`).

This test pins the **current** behaviour (no convention awareness: the whole
surface reads as removed+added → BREAKING). It is the executable spec for the
planned convention-aware mitigation (a "versioned symbol scheme" recogniser /
suppression preset): once that lands, the same input should collapse to a small,
review-able result and this test is updated to assert the reduced noise.
