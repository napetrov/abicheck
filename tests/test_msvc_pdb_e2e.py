"""MSVC + PDB end-to-end ABI tests.

This is the only lane that exercises abicheck against a *real* Microsoft
toolchain: it compiles a DLL with ``cl.exe /Zi`` (which emits a matching
``.pdb``), then runs abicheck's dump+compare over the MSVC-produced
artifacts and asserts the verdict. abicheck's pure-Python PDB parser
(`pdb_parser.py`) feeds struct/enum layout into the same `DwarfMetadata`
pipeline the ELF/DWARF path uses, so a PDB-backed snapshot can produce real
ABI verdicts.

Gated behind the ``msvc`` marker; conftest skips it when ``cl.exe`` is not
on PATH, so it is a no-op on Linux/macOS and on Windows runners without the
MSVC dev environment activated. It runs for real in the dedicated
``windows-msvc`` CI lane.

Closes the MSVC + PDB backlog item (docs/development/backlog.md).
