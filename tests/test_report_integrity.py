"""Cross-channel report-integrity tests (C2 / ADR-035).

These lock the invariant the user asked for: *a change classifies consistently
regardless of output channel*. All native channels (JSON, SARIF, JUnit, text)
must derive each finding's classification from the one canonical axis — the
per-finding effective verdict (`ReportModel.verdict_of`) — so they can never
disagree with each other or with the gate/exit code.

The ABICC-compatibility HTML severity (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW in
`report_classifications`) is deliberately a *different* axis: it mirrors ABICC's
own kind-based severity so ABICC report parsers/diffs keep working, and is
intentionally NOT driven by abicheck's policy/A4 overrides. That exception is
asserted explicitly below so it stays a conscious decision, not silent drift.
