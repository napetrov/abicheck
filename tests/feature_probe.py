"""Compiler feature probing for example-case gating.

Some example cases exercise very new language features (e.g. C23 ``_BitInt``)
that older but still-current toolchains do not implement — GCC only gained
``_BitInt`` in GCC 14, so the GCC 13 shipped on ``ubuntu-latest`` cannot
compile such a fixture at all. The compile fails *before* abicheck ever runs,
so it cannot be modelled as a verdict ``known_gap``/xfail; the case must be
*skipped* when the toolchain lacks the feature.

A case opts in by adding ``"requires_feature": "<name>"`` to its
``ground_truth.json`` entry. Both example harnesses
(``tests/test_example_autodiscovery.py`` and ``tests/validate_examples.py``)
consult :func:`compiler_supports` to decide whether to skip.

The probe actually compiles a tiny snippet with the platform's native
compiler, so it is correct across gcc/clang/MSVC and all platforms rather than
hard-coding version numbers.
